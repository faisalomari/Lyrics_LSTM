And she buttoned her boot,   And straightened her suit,   Then she said, ""Dont get cute.""   So  forced my hands in my pockets   And felt with my thumbs,   And gallantly handed her   My very last piece of gum.      She threw me outside,    stood in the dirt where evryone walked.   And after finding d forgotten my shirt,    went back and knocked.    waited in the hallway, she went to get it,   And  tried to make sense   Out of that picture of  in r wheelchair   That leaned up against--      Her Jamaican rum   And when she did come,  asked her for some.   She said, ""No, dear.""    said, ""Your words arent clear,   Youd better spit out r gum.""   She screamed till her face got so red,   Then she fell on the floor,   And  covered her up and then   Thought d go look through her drawer.      And when  was through    filled up my shoe and brought it to .   And ,  took me in,   You loved me then,  never wasted time.   And ,  never took much,    never asked for r crutch   And  dont ask for mine.  "

Bob Dylan,Ballad Of Donald White,"My name is Donald White,  see,    stand before  all.    was judged by  a murderer   And the hangmans knot must fall.    will die upon the gallows pole   When the moon is shining clear,   And these are my final words   That  will ever hear.       left my home in Kansas   When  was very ng,    landed in the old Northwest,   Seattle, Washington   Although d a-traveled many miles,    never made a friend,   For  could never get along in life   With people that  met.      f  had some education   To give me a decent start,    might have been a doctor or   A master in the arts.   But  used my hands for stealing   When  was very ng,   And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,   Thats how my life begun.      Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,    found they were my kind,   And it was there inside the bars    found my peace of mind.   But the jails they were too crowded,   nstitutions overflowed,   So they turned me loose to walk upon   Lifes hurried tangled road.      And theres danger on the ocean   Where the salt sea waves split high,   And theres danger on the battlefield   Where the shells of bullets fly,   And theres danger in this open world   Where men strive to be free,   And for me the greatest danger   Was in society.      So  asked them to send me back   To the institution home.   But they said they were too crowded,   For me they had no room.    got down on my knees and begged,   ""Oh, please put me away,""   But they would not listen to my plea   Or nothing  would say.      And so it was on Christmas eve   n the year of 59,   t was on that night  killed a man,    did not try to hide,   The jury found me guilty   And  wont disagree,   For  knew that it would happen   f  wasnt put away.      And m glad ve had no parents   To care for me or cry,   For now they will never know   The horrible death  die.   And m also glad ve had no friends   To see me in disgrace,   For theyll never see that hangmans hood   Wrap around my face.      Farewell unto the old north woods   Of which  used to roam,   Farewell unto the crowded bars   Of whichve been my home,   Farewell to all  people   Who think the worst of me,    guess ll feel much better when   m on that hanging tree.      But theres just one question   Before they kill me dead,   m wondering just how much   To   really said   Concerning all the boys that come   Down a road like me,   Are they enemies or victims   Of r society?

Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's Dream,"While riding on a train goin west,    fell asleep for to take my rest.    dreamed a dream that made me sad,   Concerning myself and the first few friends  had.      With half-damp eyes  stared to the room   Where my friends and  spent many an afternoon,   Where we together weathered many a storm,   Laughin and singin till the early hours of the morn.      By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,   Our words were told, our songs were sung,   Where we longed for nothin and were quite satisfied   Talkin and a-jokin about the world outside.      With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,   We never thought we could ever get old.   We thought we could sit forever in fun   But our chances really was a million to one.      As easy it was to tell black from white,   t was all that easy to tell wrong from right.   And our choices were few and the thought never hit   That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.      How many a year has passed and gone,   And many a gamble has been lost and won,   And many a road taken by many a friend,   And each one ve never seen again.       wish,  wish,  wish in vain,   That we could sit simply in that room again.   Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,   d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.  "

He says, "" know of a woman   That can fix  up fast. ""    didnt think twice,    said like  should,   ""Lets go find this lady   That can do me some good. ""   We walked across the river   On a sailin spree   And we came to a door   Called one-oh-three.       was just about ready   To give it a little knock   When out comes a fella   Who couldnt even walk.   Hes linkin and a-slinkin,   Couldnt stand on his feet,   And he moaned and he groaned   And he shuffled down the street.   Well, out of the door   There comes another man.   He wiggled and he wobbled,   He couldnt hardly stand.   He had this frightened   Look in his eyes,   Like he just fought a bear,   He was ready to die.      Well,  peeked through the key crack,   Comin down the hall   Was a long-legged man   Who couldnt hardly crawl.   He muttered and he uttered   n broken French,   And he looked like hed been through   A monkey wrench.      Well, by this time    was a-scared to knock,    was a-scared to move,   s in a state of shock.    hummed a little tune   And  shuffled my feet   And  started walkin backwards   Down that broad street.   Well,  got to the corner,    tried my best to smile.    turned around the corner   And  ran a bloody mile.   Man,  wasnt runnin   Cause  was sick,    was just a-runnin   To get out of there quick.      Well,  tripped right along   And m a-wheezin in my chest.    musta run a mile   n a minute or less.    walked on a log   And  tripped on a stump,    caught a fast freight   With a one-arm jump.

Bob Dylan,Chimes Of Freedom,"Far between sundowns finish an midnights broken toll   We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing   As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds   Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing   Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight   Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight   An for each an evry underdog soldier in the night   An we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.      n the citys melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched   With faces hidden while the walls were tightening   As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin rain   Dissolved into the bells of the lightning   Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake   Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an forsakened   Tolling for the outcast, burnin constantly at stake   An we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.      Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail   The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder   That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze   Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder   Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind   Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind   An the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time   An we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.      Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales   For the disrobed faceless forms of no position   Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts   All down in taken-for-granted situations   Tolling for the deaf an blind, tolling for the mute   Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute   For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an cheated by pursuit   An we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.      Even though a clouds white curtain in a far-off corner flashed   An the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting   Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones   Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting   Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail   For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale   An for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail   An we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.      Starry-eyed an laughing as  recall when we were caught   Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended   As we listened one last time an we watched with one last look   Spellbound an swallowed til the tolling ended   Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed   For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an worse   An for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe   An we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Bob Dylan,Clean-Cut Kid,"Everybodys asking why he couldnt adjust   Adjust to what, a dream that bust?      They took a clean-cut kid   And they made a killer out of him   Thats what they did.      They said whats up is down, they said what isnt is   They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.      They took a clean-cut kid   And they made him a killer   Thats what they did.      He was on the basketball team, he was in the marching band   When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand.      They took a clean-cut kid   And they made a killer out of him   Thats what they did.      They said, ""Listen boy, re just a pup""   They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.      They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills   A jeep to drive, blood to spill.      They said, ""Congratulation,  got what it takes""   They sent him back into the race without any brakes.      They took a clean-cut kid   And they made a killer out of him   Thats what they did.      He bought the American Dream but put it in doubt   Only game he could play was Russian Roulette.      He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread   He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.      He went to Hollywood to see Peter OToole   He stole a Rolls Royce and drove in a pool.      They took a clean-cut kid   And they made a killer out of him   Thats what they did.      He couldve sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar   He couldve been an accountant or a tennis star.      He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day   Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.      His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans   They gotta sleep together in a home they dont own.      They took a clean-cut kid   And they made a killer out of him   Thats what they did.      Everybodys asking why he didnt adjust   All he wanted was somebody to trust.      They took his head and turned it inside out   He never did know what it was all about.      He had a steady job, he joined the choir   He never did plan to walk the high wire.      They took a clean-cut kid   And they made a killer out of him Thats what they did.  "
Bob Dylan,Clothes Line,"After a while we took in the clothes,   Nobody said very much.   Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants   Which nobody really wanted to touch.   Mama come in and picked up a book   An Papa asked her what it was.   Someone else asked, ""What do  care?""   Papa said, ""Well, just because.""   Then they started to take back their clothes,   Hang em on the line.   t was January the thirtieth   And everybody was feelin fine.      The next day everybody got up   Seein if the clothes were dry.   The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed,   Mama, of course, she said, ""Hi!""   ""Have  heard the news?"" he said, with a grin,   ""The Vice-Presidents gone mad!""   ""Where?"" ""Downtown."" ""When?"" ""Last night.""   ""Hmm, say, thats too bad!""   ""Well, theres nothin we can do about it,"" said the neighbor,   ""ts just somethin were gonna have to forget.""   ""Yes,  guess so,"" said Ma,   Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet.       reached up, touched my shirt,   And the neighbor said, ""Are those clothes rs?""    said, ""Some of em, not all of em.""   He said, ""Ya always help out around here with the chores?""    said, ""Sometime, not all the time.""   Then my neighbor, he blew his nose   Just as papa yelled outside,   ""Mama wants  t come back in the house and bring them clothes.""   Well,  just do what m told,   So,  did it, of course.    went back in the house and Mama met me   And then  shut all the doors.  "
Bob Dylan,Copper Kettle,"Get  a copper kettle, get  a copper coil   Fill it with new made corn mash and never more ll toil   Youll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright   Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.      Build  a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak   Dont use no green or rotten wood, theyll get  by the smoke   Youll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright   Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.

Bob Dylan,Dark Eyes,"Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside   Theyre drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide    live in another world where life and death are memorized   Where the earth is strung with lovers pearls and all  see are dark eyes.      A cock is crowing far away and another soldiers deep in prayer   Some mothers child has gone astray, she cant find him anywhere   But  hear another rum beating for the dead that rise   Whom natures beast fear as they come and all  see are dark eyes.      They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes   They tell me revenge is sweet, m sure it is   But  feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized   All  feel is heat and flame, and all  see are dark eyes.      Oh, the French girl, shes in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel   Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling god of speed and steel   Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies   A million faces at my feet but all  see are dark eyes.

Bob Dylan,Dusty Old Fairgrounds,"by Bob Dylan      Well, its all up from Florida at the start of the spring,   The trucks and the trailers will be winding   Like a bullet well shoot for the carnival route.   Were following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.      From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun   Cross that Minnesota border, keep em scrambling   Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands,   Were following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.      Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen   Cross them old Black Hills, keep em rolling   Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana.   Were following them fairgrounds a-calling.      As the white line on the highway sails under r wheels,   ve gazed from the trailer window laughing.   Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright.   Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.      ts a-many a friend that follows the bend,   The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers.   Well, ve spent my time with the fortune-telling kind   Following them fairgrounds a-calling.      Oh, its pound down the rails and its tie down the tents,   Get that canvas flag a-flying.   Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind   Following them fairgrounds a-calling.      Well, its roll into town straight to the fairgrounds   Just behind the posters that are hanging   And its fill up every space with a different kind of face   Following them fairgrounds a-calling.      Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind,   Hear that old music box a-banging.   Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles   Were following them fairgrounds a-calling.      ts a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town,   Hit the old highway by the morning   And its ride rself blind for the next town on time   Following them fairgrounds a-calling.      As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime   Drinking red wine as were rolling,   Many a turnin  turn, many a lesson  learn   From following them fairgrounds a-calling.      And its roll back down to St. Petersburg   Tie down the trailers and camp em   And the money that we made will pay for the space   From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  "

And then  drift away on a summers day where the wildflowers bloom   With r golden loom.       walk across the bridge in the dismal light   Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.    see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail   And then  kiss r lips as  lift r veil.   But re gone and then all  seem to recall is the smell of perfume   And r golden loom.  "

My head tells me its time to make a change   But my heart is telling me  love ya but re strange.      One more time at midnight, near the wall   Take off r heavy make-up and r shawl.

Bob Dylan,Arthur Mcbride,"Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,   As we went a-walkin down by the seaside,   Mark now what followed and what did betide,   For it bein on Christmas mornin   Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp,   And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp   And a little wee drummer intending to camp,   For the day bein pleasant and charmin.      ""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant he cried.   ""And the same to , gentlemen,"" we did reply,   ntending no harm but meant to pass by,   For it bein on Christmas mornin   ""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if  will enlist,   Ten guineas in gold ll stick to r fist,   And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,   And drink the kings health in the morning.      ""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life,   And he always is blessed with a charming ng wife,   And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,   And he always lives pleasant and charmin,   And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,   n the finest of clothing hes constantly seen.   While other poor fellows go dirty and mean,   And sup on thin gruel in the morning.""      ""But,"" says Arthur, "" wouldnt be proud of r clothes,   For ve only the lend of them, as  suppose,   But  dare not change them one night, for  know   f  do, ll be flogged in the morning,   And although that were single and free,   We take great delight in our own company,   We have no desire strange places to see,   Although that r offers are charming.      ""And we have no desire to take r advance,   All hazards and dangers we barter on chance,   For d have no scruples for to send us to France,   Where we would get shot without warning,""   ""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant. ""ll have no such chat,   And neither will  take it from snappy ng brats,   For if  insult me with one other word,   ll cut off r heads in the morning.""      And Arthur and , we soon drew our hogs,   And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades   When a trusty shillelagh came over their head   And bid them take that as fair warning.   And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,   We flung them as far as we could in the tide,   ""Now take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride,   ""And temper their edge in the mornin!""      And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,   And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,   Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,   And bade it a tedious returning,   And we havin no money, paid them off in cracks.   We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,   And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,   And left them for dead in the morning.      And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,   We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,   For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts   And bid them look sharp in the mornin.

Bob Dylan,As I Went Out One Morning,"As  went out one morning   To breathe the air around Tom Paines,    spied the fairest damsel   That ever did walk in chains.    offerd her my hand,   She took me by the arm.    knew that very instant,   She meant to do me harm.      ""Depart from me this moment,""    told her with my voice.   Said she, ""But  dont wish to,""   Said , ""But  have no choice.""   "" beg , sir,"" she pleaded   From the corners of her mouth,   "" will secretly accept    And together well fly south.""      Just then Tom Paine, himself,   Came running from across the field,   Shouting at this lovely girl   And commanding her to yield.   And as she was letting go her grip,   Up Tom Paine did run,   ""m sorry, sir,"" he said to me,   ""m sorry for what shes done.""  "

Bob Dylan,Ballad For A Friend,"Sad m sittin on the railroad track,   Watchin that old smokestack.   Train is a-leavin but it wont be back.      Years ago we hang around,   Watchin trains roll through the town.   Now that train is a-graveyard bound.      Where we go up in that North country,   Lakes and streams and mines so free,    had no better friend than he.      Something happened to him that day,    thought  heard a stranger say,    hung my head and stole away.      A diesel truck was headin down,   Pullin down a heavy load.   t left him on a Utah road.      They carried him back to his home town,   His mother cried, his sister moaned,   Listenin to them church bells tone.      A diesel truck was rollin slow,   Pullin down a heavy load.   And it left him on a Utah road.  "
Bob Dylan,Ballad In Plain D," once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.   With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.    courted her proudly but now she is gone,   Gone as the season shes taken.      Through ng summers breeze,  stole her away   From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.   Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,   With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.      Of the two sisters,  loved the ng.   With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.   The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone   By the jealousy of others around her.      For her parasite sister,  had no respect,   Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.   Countless visions of the other shed reflect   As a crutch for her scenes and her society.      Myself, for what  did,  cannot be excused,   The changes  was going through cant even be used,   For the lies that  told her in hopes not to lose   The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.      With unknown consciousness,  possessed in my grip   A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,   Noticing not that d already slipped   To a sin of loves false security.      From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,   Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,   Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, ""Please,   Whats wrong and whats exactly the matter?""      And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,   The timeless explosion of fantasys dream.   At the peak of the night, the king and the queen   Tumbled all down into pieces.      ""The tragic figure!"" her sister did shout,   ""Leave her alone, God damn , get out!""   And  in my armor, turning about   And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.      Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound   Her sister and  in a screaming battleground.   And she in between, the victim of sound,   Soon shattered as a child neath her shadows.      All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.    gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.   My mind it was mangled,  ran into the night   Leaving all of loves ashes behind me.      The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.   The words to say m sorry,  havent found yet.    think of her often and hope whoever shes met   Will be fully aware of how precious she is.      Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,   ""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""   And  answer them most mysteriously,   ""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?""  "
Bob Dylan,Ballad Of A Thin Man,"You walk into the room with r pencil in r hand   You see somebody naked and  say, ""Who is that man?""

Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to  and then he kneels   He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels   And without further notice, he asks  how it feels   And he says, ""Here is r throat back, thanks for the loan""   And  know something is happening but  dont know what it is   Do , Mr. Jones?      Now,  see this one-eyed midget shouting the word ""Now""   And  say, ""For what reason?"" and he says, ""How""   And  say, ""What does this mean?"" and he screams back, ""Youre a cow!   Give me some milk or else go home""   And  know somethings happening but  dont know what it is   Do , Mr. Jones?      Well,  walk into the room like a camel, and then  frown   You put r eyes in r pocket and r nose on the ground   There ought to be a law against  comin around   You should be made to wear earphones   Cause something is happening and  dont know what it is   Do , Mr. Jones?

Bob Dylan,Black Diamond Bay,"Up on the white veranda   She wears a necktie and a Panama hat.   Her passport shows a face   From another time and place   She looks nothing like that.   And all the remnants of her recent past   Are scattered in the wild wind.   She walks across the marble floor   Where a voice from the gambling room is callin her to come on in.   She smiles, walks the other way   As the last ship sails and the moon fades away   From Black Diamond Bay.      As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down   And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.   ""Pardon, monsieur,"" the desk clerk says,   Carefully removes his fez,   ""Am  hearing  right?""   And as the yellow fog is lifting   The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor.   She passes him on the spiral staircase   Thinking hes the Soviet Ambassador,   She starts to speak, but he walks away   As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway   On Black Diamond Bay.      A soldier sits beneath the fan   Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.   Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.   The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,   ""Can  see anything?""   Then the Greek appears on the second floor   n his bare feet with a rope around his neck,   While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,   Says, ""Open up another deck.""   But the dealer says, ""Attendez-vous, sil vous plait,   As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away   From Black Diamond Bay.      The desk clerk heard the woman laugh   As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.   He tried to grab the womans hand,   Said, ""Heres a ring, it cost a grand.""   She said, ""That aint enough.""   Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags   While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.   She passed the door that the Greek had locked,   Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do Not Disturb.""   She knocked upon it anyway   As the sun went down and the music did play   On Black Diamond Bay.      ""ve got to talk to someone quick!""   But the Greek said, ""Go away,"" and he kicked the chair to the floor.   He hung there from the chandelier.   She cried, ""Help, theres danger near   Please open up the door!""   Then the volcano erupted   And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.   The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner   Thinking of forbidden love.   But the desk clerk said, ""t happens every day,""   As the stars fell down and the fields burned away   On Black Diamond Bay.      As the island slowly sank   The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.   The dealer said, ""ts too late now.   You can take r money, but  dont know how   Youll spend it in the tomb.""   The tiny man bit the soldiers ear   As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,   While shes out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,   ""My darling, je vous aime beaucoup.""   She sheds a tear and then begins to pray   As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away   From Black Diamond Bay.       was sitting home alone one night in L.A.,   Watching old Cronkite on the seven oclock news.   t seems there was an earthquake that   Left nothing but a Panama hat   And a pair of old Greek shoes.   Didnt seem like much was happening,   So  turned it off and went to grab another beer.   Seems like every time  turn around   Theres another hard-luck story that re gonna hear   And theres really nothing anyone can say   And  never did plan to go anyway   To Black Diamond Bay.  "

Well, she pulled off them long blue gloves   All made of the finest leather.   Gave to him her lily-white hand   And said good-bye forever.   Bid farewell forever.      ""Would  forsake r house and home,   Would  forsake r baby?   Would  forsake r husband, too,   To go with Black Jack Davey.   Rode off with Black Jack Davey?""      ""Well, ll forsake my house and home,   And ll forsake my baby.   ll forsake my husband, too,   For the love of Black Jack Davey.   Ride off with Black Jack Davey.""      ""Last night  slept in a feather bed   Between my husband and baby.   Tonight  lay on the river banks   n the arms of Black Jack Davey,   Love my Black Jack Davey.""  "

Bob Dylan,Blue Moon,"Blue moon,  saw me standing alone   Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own.      Blue moon,  knew just what  was there for   You heard me saying a prayet for someone  really could care for.      And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold    heard someone whisper, ""Please, adore me""   And when  looked my moon had turned to gold.      Blue moon, now m no longer alone   Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own   Without a love of my own.  "
Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's 115Th Dream," was riding on the Mayflower when  thought  spied some land    yelled down to Captain Arab, ll have ya understand,   Who came running to the deck and said ""Boys! Forget the whale -   Were goin over yonder. Cut the engines. Change the sails.""   ""Haul on that bowline!"" we sang that melody,   Like all tough sailors do when theyre far away at sea.      "" think ll call it America.""  said as we hit land.    took a deep breath.  fell down,  could not stand.   Captain Arab he starting writing out some deeds   And said ""Lets build us a fort and start buying the place with beads.?   Just then a cop come down the street crazy as a loon   And throws us all in jail for carryin harpoons.      Aw, me,  busted out - dont even ask me how,    went lookin for some help,  walked past a Guernsey cow   Who directed me down to the Bowery slums   Where people carried signs around sayin ""BAN THE BUMS!"".    jumped right in line, sayin "" hope that m not late""   When  realized  hadnt eaten for five days straight.       went into a restaurant lookin for the cook -    told him  was the editor of a famous etiquette book.   The waiter he was handsome and he wore a powder blue cape.    ordered up some Suzette,  said ""Could  please make that crepe?""   Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat -   Food was flyin everywhere -  left without my hat.       didnt mean to be nosy so  went into a bank   To try to get some bail for the boys back in the tank.   They asked me for some collateral and  pulled down my pants.   They threw me in the alley, when up comes this girl from France   Who invited me to her place.  went, but she had a friend   Who knocked me out an robbed my boots an was  on the street again.       went up to a big house with a U.S. flag upon display.    said ""Can  please help me out,  got some friends down the way.""   The man said ""Get out of here or ll tear  limb from limb.""    said ""You know, they refused Jesus, too."" He said ""Youre not him.   Get out of here before  break r bones. m not r pop.""    decided to have him arrested and went looking for a cop.       ran back outside and got into a cab    ran out the other door - this English man said ""Fab!""   As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood   Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.    ran right through the door like a hobo sailor does,   But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who  was    repeated that all my friends were in jail, with a sigh.   He gave me his card and said ""Call me if they die.""    shook his hand and said goodbye and went back out on the street,   When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.   A pay phone was ringin - and it just about blew my mind -   When  picked it up an said ""hello"", this foot came through the line!      Well about this time  was fed up at trying to make a stab   At gettin any help for my friends and Captain Arab.    needed a coin to flip, like either heads or tails,   Would let me know if  should go back to ship or back to jail.   So  hocked my sailors suit an  got a coin to flip.   t came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so  made it back to the ship.      Well  got back and took the parking ticket off the mast.    was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past.   They asked me my name and  said ""Captain Kidd"".   They believed me but they wanted to know exactly what  did.    said ""For the Pope of Eyruke  was employed""   They let me go right away, they were very paranoid.      Well the last  heard of Arab he was stuck on the side of a whale   That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail,   But the funniest thing was - as  was leavin the bay -    saw three ships sailing and they were all headed my way.   So  asked the Captain what his name was an how come he didnt drive a truck??   He said his name was Columbus an  just said ""Good luck...""  "

Bob Dylan,Caribbean Wind,"She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost   From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross.    was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.   Told about Jesus, told about the rain,   She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain   By a man who danced on the roof of the embassy.      Was she a child or a woman,  cant say which   From one to another she could to easily switch   We went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach.   Could  been used and played as a pawn?   t certainly was possible as the gay night wore on   Where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech.      And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico   Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire   And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,   Bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire.      She looked into my soul through the clothes that  wore   She said, ""We got a mutual friend over by the door,   And  know hes got our best interest in mind.""   He was well connected but her heart was a snare   And she had left him to die in there,   There were payments due and he was a little behind.      The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,   Ceiling fan broken, theres a heat in my bed,   Street band playing ""Nearer My God to Thee.""   We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring,   She said, "" know what re thinking, but there aint a thing   You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree.""      And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico   Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire   And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,   Bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire.      Atlantic City by the cold grey sea    hear a voice crying, ""Daddy,""  always think its for me,   But its only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.   Every new messenger brings evil report   Bout armies on the march and time that is short   And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls.      Would  have married her?  dont know,  suppose.   She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes   But  kept hearing my name and  had to be movin on.    saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin,    saw a house in the country being torn from within.    heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.      And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico   Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire   And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,   Bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire.

Bob Dylan,Catch The Wind,"n the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty,    want to be in the warm heart of r loving mind.   To feel  all around me,   And to take r hand along the sand,   Ah, but  may as well try and catch the wind.      When sundown pales the sky,    want to hide a while behind r smile,   And everywhere  look r eyes  find.   For me to love  now, would be the sweetest thing,   Twould make me sing,   Ah, but  may as well try and catch the wind.      When rain has hung the leaves with tears,    want  near, to kill my fears,   To help me to leave all my blues behind.   Standing in r heart is where  want to be   And long to be,   Ah, but  may as well try and catch the wind.      Ah, but  may as well try and catch the wind.  "
Bob Dylan,Changing Of The Guards,"Sixteen years,   Sixteen banners united over the field   Where the good shepherd grieves.   Desperate men, desperate women divided,   Spreading their wings neath the falling leaves.      Fortune calls.    stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,   Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.   Shes smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,   On midsummers eve, near the tower.      The cold-blooded moon.   The captain waits above the celebration   Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid   Whose ebony face is beyond communication.   The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.      They shaved her head.   She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.   A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.    seen her on the stairs and  couldnt help but follow,   Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.       stumbled to my feet.    rode past destruction in the ditches   With the stitches still mending neath a heart-shaped tattoo.   Renegade priests and treacherous ng witches   Were handing out the flowers that d given to .      The palace of mirrors   Where dog soldiers are reflected,   The endless road and the wailing of chimes,   The empty rooms where her memory is protected,   Where the angels voices whisper to the souls of previous times.      She wakes him up   Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking   Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.   Shes begging to know what measures he now will be taking.   Hes pulling her down and shes clutching on to his long golden locks.      Gentlemen, he said,    dont need r organization, ve shined r shoes,   ve moved r mountains and marked r cards   But Eden is burning, either brace rself for elimination   Or else r hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.      Peace will come   With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire   But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall   And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating   Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

Bob Dylan,Dirge," hate myself for lovin  and the weakness that it showed   You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.   The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,    hate myself for lovin  and m glad the curtain fell.       hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed   And the mercy that  showed to me, who ever would have guessed?    went out on Lower Broadway and  felt that place within,   That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.      Heard r songs of freedom and man forever stripped,   Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.   Like a slave in orbit, hes beaten til hes tame,   All for a moments glory and its a dirty, rotten shame.      There are those who worship loneliness, m not one of them,   n this age of fiberglass m searching for a gem.   The crystal ball up on the wall hasnt shown me nothing yet,   ve paid the price of solitude, but at last m out of debt.      Cant recall a useful thing  ever did for me   Cept pat me on the back one time when  was on my knees.   We stared into each others eyes til one of us would break,   No use to apologize, what diffrence would it make?      So sing r praise of progress and of the Doom Machine,   The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.   Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell  where m at,    hate myself for lovin , but  should get over that.  "

Aint no use jiving   Aint no use joking   Everything is broken.      Broken bottles, broken plates,   Broken switches, broken gates,   Broken dishes, broken parts,   Streets are filled with broken hearts.

Take a deep breath, feel like re chokin,   Everything is broken.

Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,   Everything is broken.  "

See the cross-eyed pirates sitting   Perched in the sun   Shooting tin cans   With a sawed-off shotgun   And the neighbors they clap   And they cheer with each blast   Farewell Angelina   The skys changing color   And  must leave fast.      King Kong, little elves   On the rooftoops they dance   Valentino-type tangos   While the make-up mans hands   Shut the eyes of the dead   Not to embarrass anyone   Farewell Angelina   The sky is embarrassed   And  must be gone.      The machine guns are roaring   The puppets heave rocks   The fiends nail time bombs   To the hands of the clocks   Call me any name  like    will never deny it   Farewell Angelina   The sky is erupting    must go where its quiet.

Bob Dylan,George Jackson," woke up this mornin,   There were tears in my bed.   They killed a man  really loved   Shot him through the head.   Lord, Lord,   They cut George Jackson down.   Lord, Lord,   They laid him in the ground.      Sent him off to prison   For a seventy-dollar robbery.   Closed the door behind him   And they threw away the key.   Lord, Lord, They cut George Jackson down.   Lord, Lord,   They laid him in the ground.      He wouldnt take shit from no one   He wouldnt bow down or kneel.   Authorities, they hated him   Because he was just too real.   Lord, Lord,   They cut George Jackson down.   Lord, Lord,   They laid him in the ground.      Prison guards, they cursed him   As they watched him from above   But they were frightened of his power   They were scared of his love.   Lord, Lord,   So they cut George Jackson down.   Lord, Lord,   They laid him in the ground.      Sometimes  think this whole world   s one big prison yard.   Some of us are prisoners   The rest of us are guards.   Lord, Lord,   They cut George Jackson down.   Lord, Lord,   They laid him in the ground.  "

Theres a song that will linger forever in our ears,   Oh, hard times, come again no more.   Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.   Hard times, hard times, come again no more.   Many days  have lingered all around my cabin door.   Oh, hard times, come again no more.      While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.   There are frail forms fainting at the door.   Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say.   Oh, hard times, come again no more.   Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.   Hard times, hard times, come again no more.   Many days  have lingered all around my cabin door.   Oh, hard times, come again no more.      Theres pale drooping maiden who foils her life away   With a worn out heart, whose better days are oer.   Though her voice it would be merry, tis sighing all the day,   Oh, hard times, come again no more.   Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.   Hard times, hard times, come again no more.   Many days  have lingered all around my cabin door.   Oh, hard times, come again no more.      Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.   Hard times, hard times, come again no more.

Bob Dylan,Huck's Tune,"Well  wandered alone,   Through a desert of stone,   And  dreamed of my future wife.   My swords in my hand,   And m next in command,   n this version of Death called Life.   My plate and my cup,   Are right straight up,    took a rose from the hand of a child.   When  kiss r lips,   The honey drips,   m gonna have to put  down for a while.      Every day we meet,   On any old street,   And re in r girlish prime.   The short and the tall,   Are coming to the ball,    go there all the time.   Behind every tree,   Theres something to see,   The river is wider than a mile.    tried  twice,   You cant be nice,   m gonna have to put  down for a while.      Here come the nurse,   With money in her purse,   Here come the ladies and men.   You push it all in,   And ve no chance to win,   You play em on down to the end.   m laying in the sand,   Getting a sunshine tan,   Moving along, riding in style.   From my toes to my head,   You knock me dead,   m gonna have to put  down for a while.       count the years,   And  shed no tears,   m blinded to what might have been.   Natures voice,   Makes my heart rejoice,   Play me the wild song of the wind.    found hopeless love,   n the room above,   When the sun and the weather were riled.   Youre as fine as wine,    aint handing  no line,   m gonna have to put  down for a while.      All the merry little elves,   Can go hang themselves,   My faith is as cold as can be.   m stacked high to the roof,   And m not without proof,   f  dont believe me, come see.   You think m blue,    think so, too,   n my words ll find no guile.   The games gotten old,   The decks gone cold,   And m gonna have to put  down for a while.      The games gotten old,   The decks gone cold,   And m gonna have to put  down for a while.  "
Bob Dylan,I And I,"Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed   Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams   n another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed   To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.       and    n creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives    and    One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.      Think ll go out and go for a walk   Not much happening here, nothing ever does   Besides, if she wakes up now, shell just want to talk    got nothing to say, specially about whatever it was.       and    n creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives    and    One say to the other, no man see my face and lives.      Took an untrodden path once, where the swift dont win the race   t goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth   Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justices beautiful face   And see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.       and    n creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives    and    One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.      Outside of two men on a train platform theres nothing in sight   Theyre waiting for spring to come, smoking down the trck   The world could come to an end tonight, bt thats all right   She could still be there sleeping when  get back.       and    n creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives    and    One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.      Noontime, and m still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part   nto the narrow lanes,  cant stumble or stay put   Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but m listening with my heart   ve made shoes for everyone, even , while  go barefoot.       and    n creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives    and    One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.

They show me to the door   They say dont come back no more   Cause  dont be like theyd like me to   And ,  walk out on my own   A thousand miles from home   But  dont feel alone   Cause  believe in .       believe in  even through the tears and the laughter    believe in  even though we be apart    believe in  even on the morning after   Oh, when the dawn is nearing   Oh, when the night is disappearing   Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart.

Bob Dylan,I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine," dreamed  saw St. Augustine   Alive as  or me   Tearing through these quarters   n the utmost misery   With a blanket underneath his arm   And a coat of solid gold   Searching for the very souls   Whom already have been sold.      ""Arise, arise"", he cried so loud   With a voice without restraint   ""Come out ye gifted kings and queens   And hear my sad complaint   No martyr is among ye now   Whom  can call r own   So go on r way accordingly   But know re not alone"".       dreamed  saw St. Augustine   Alive with fiery breath   And  dreamed  was amongst the ones   That put him out to death   Oh,  awoke in anger   So alone and terrified    put my fingers against the glass   And bowed my head and cried.

Bob Dylan,I Pity The Poor Immigrant," pity the poor immigrant   Who wishes he wouldve stayed home,   Who uses all his power to do evil   But in the end is always left so alone.   That man whom with his fingers cheats   And who lies with evry breath,   Who passionately hates his life   And likewise, fears his death.       pity the poor immigrant   Whose strength is spent in vain,   Whose heaven is like ronsides,   Whose tears are like rain,   Who eats but is not satisfied,   Who hears but does not see,   Who falls in love with wealth itself   And turns his back on me.       pity the poor immigrant   Who tramples through the mud,   Who fills his mouth with laughing   And who builds his town with blood,   Whose visions in the final end   Must shatter like the glass.    pity the poor immigrant   When his gladness comes to pass.

Bob Dylan,I Shall Be Released,"They say evrything can be replaced,   Yet every distance is not near.   So  remember every face   Of every man who put me here.    see my light come shining   From the west onto the east.   Any day now, any day how,    shall be released.      They say every man needs protection,   They say every man must fall.   Yet  swear  see my reflection   Some place so high above this wall.    see my light come shining   From the west onto the east.   Any day now, any day how,    shall be released.      Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,   s a man who swears hes not to blame.   All day long  hear him shout so loud,   Crying out that he was framed.    see my light come shining   From the west onto the east.   Any day now, any day how,    shall be released.  "
Bob Dylan,I Threw It All Away," once held her in my arms,   She said she would always stay.   But  was cruel,    treated her like a fool,    threw it all away.      Once  had mountains in the palm of my hand,   And rivers that ran through evry day.    must have been mad,    never knew what  had,   Until  threw it all away.      Love is all there is, it makes the world go round,   Love and only love, it cant be denied.   No matter what  think about it   You just wont be able to do without it.   Take a tip from one whos tried.      So if  find someone that gives  all of her love,   Take it to r heart, dont let it stray,   For one thing thats certain,   You will surely be a-hurtin,   f  throw it all away.  "
