ABBA,Ahe's My Kind Of Girl,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

ABBA,"Andante, Andante","Take it easy with me, please  
Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze

ABBA,As Good As New,"I'll never know why I had to go  
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show  
Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff  
Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough  
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta have you near  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap  
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
How could I make such a dumb mistake  
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break  
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta get you near  
  
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together

ABBA,Bang,"Making somebody happy is a question of give and take  
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break  
Every smile and every little touch  
Don't you know that they mean so much  
Sweet sweet kisses so tender  
Always will return to sender  
  
Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum  
So give it away, I think you'll learn  
You'll get love in return  
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
A boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere  
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care  
Never use it as a selfish tool  
Never ever be such a fool  
Every feeling you're showing  
Is a boomerang you're throwing  
  
Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang

ABBA,Burning My Bridges,"Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad  
And I've always been under your heel  
Holy christ what a lousy deal  
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
And I ain't gonna take it no more  
Oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
Burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
Once again I wanna look into the eye  
Being myself  
Counting my pride  
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
Burning my bridges  
Moving at last  
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past  
Gonna have peace now  
You can be free  
No one here will make a sucker out of me

"
ABBA,Cassandra,"Down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I'm sorry Cassandra  
I'm sorry Cassandra

ABBA,Chiquitita,"Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong  
You're enchained by your own sorrow  
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
How I hate to see you like this  
There is no way you can deny it  
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
I'm a shoulder you can cry on  
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on  
You were always sure of yourself  
Now I see you've broken a feather  
I hope we can patch it up together  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
  
So the walls came tumbling down  
And your love's a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
There is no way you can deny it  
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

ABBA,Crazy World,"I was out with the morning sun  
Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd take a walk  
I was thinking of you and me  
And I went to your house, 'cause I had to talk  
  
I could hardly believe my eyes  
When I saw this guy closing your front door  
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
As he disapeared in his car  
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do  
Everything I had ever dreamed  
  
Everything in my life's part of you  
And I just couldn't move my feet  
So I stood on the pavement as you came out  
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
Baby, how could you do it  
You just told me lies  
  
And you meet behind my back  
With other guys  
Baby, how could you tell me  
There was only me  
  
I was stupid to believe you  
I was blind but now I see  
Then you smiled and you took my hand  
""There is something"", you said, ""that you may not know  
  
There's a couple of men in my life  
And one of them is my brother Joe  
He's been gone for a long, long time  
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay  
  
You'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way""  
Then I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world

ABBA,Crying Over You,"I'm waitin' for you baby  
I'm sitting all alone  
I feel so cold without you  
It chills me to the bone  
I never thought you'd leave me  
But now I know it's true  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
I'm waitin' for you baby  
I'm sittin' all alone  
I feel so cold without you  
It chills me to the bone

ABBA,Dance,"Oh, my love it makes me sad.  
Why did things turn out so bad?  
Was it just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?  
  
Baby, give me one more  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Don't think about tomorrow  
Dance and forget our time is gone  
Tonight's a night we borrow.  
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own  
A thing to remember when we're all alone  
So dance, it's our way to say goodbye  
  
Yes, all we have to do is  
Dance while the music still goes on  
This is no time for crying  
Dance, don't you hear them play our song  
God knows that we've been trying  
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same  
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame  
So dance while the music still goes on  
And let it be our last goodbye  
  
Yet it seems to make me sad.  
Why did things turn out so bad?  
Was is just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?  
  
Baby, give me one last  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Just like the night I met you  
Dance and believe me, when you're gone  
You know I won't forget you  
Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away  
You tell me it's over, what more can I say?  
So dance while the music still goes on  
It's gonna be our last goodbye  
  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Don't think about tomorrow  
Dance and forget our time is gone  
Tonight's a night we borrow.  
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own  
A thing to remember when we're all alone  
So dance while the music still goes on  
And let it be our last goodbye  
  
Dance while the music still goes on  
This is no time for crying  
Dance, don't you hear them play our song  
God knows that we've been trying  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Just like the night I met you  
Dance and believe me, when you're gone  
You know I won't forget you

ABBA,Dancing Queen,"You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Queen  
  
Friday night and the lights are low  
Looking out for the place to go  
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing  
You come in to look for a king  
Anybody could be that guy  
Night is young and the music's high  
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Queen  
  
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on  
Leave them burning and then you're gone  
Looking out for another, anyone will do  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Queen

ABBA,Disillusion,"Changing, moving in a circle  
I can see your face in all of my dreams  
Smiling, laughing from the shadows  
When I hear your voice, I know what it means  
I know it doesn't matter just how hard I try  
You're all the reason for my life  
  
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down  
You're all I had, you're all I want  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have  
  
Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows  
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd  
Thinking, wondering what you're doing  
I can't stop myself from crying out loud  
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar  
But then, they never shared our love  
  
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down  
You're all I had, you're all I want  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have

ABBA,Eagle,"They came flying from far away, now I'm under their spell  
I love hearing the stories that they tell  
They've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons  
They speak strangely but I understand  
  
And I dream I'm an eagle  
And I dream I can spread my wings  
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky  
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
High, high, what a feeling to fly  
Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please  
  
As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing  
I have questions and they know everything  
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher  
Am I dreaming or is it all real?  
  
Is it true I'm an eagle?  
Is it true I can spread my wings?  
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)  
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
High, high, what a feeling to fly (What a feeling)  
Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please

In the firelight Fernando  
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  
I could hear the distant drums  
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar  
  
They were closer now Fernando  
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  
I was so afraid Fernando  
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
And I'm not ashamed to say  
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry  
  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Now we're old and grey Fernando  
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?  
I can see it in your eyes  
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land  
  
(Repeat x2)  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Yes, if I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando...

ABBA,Fernando (In Spanish),"Puedes escuchar Fernando?  
Me recuerda tiempo atras  
Estrellas y una noche alla  
En la lumbre azul Fernando  
Tarareabas tu cancion  
Con ese suave guitarrear  
Yo podia escuchar  
Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar  
  
Se acercaban mas fernando  
Y el momento que pasaba  
Parecia eternidad  
Y senti temor Fernando  
Por la vida y juventud  
Nadie pensaba en morir  
Y no siento hoy verguenza al  
Confesar que tuve  
Ganas de llorar  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
La vejez llego Fernando  
Y con ella una paz  
Que hoy logramos disfrutar  
Se durmio el tambor Fernando  
Paraciera que fue ayer  
Que lo vivimos tu y yo  
Y en tus ojos veo aun  
Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando

De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder

Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando

ABBA,Free As A Bumble Bee,"I'm down and I feel depressed  
Sitting here just waiting  
For next bus travelling  
Downtown  
It's a crying shame  
Isn't it  
The beautiful weather  
If I could have my way  
Well, I would not be working  
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be  
As free as a bumble bee  
Take a sip from  
Every flower  
Free as a bumble bee  
While away each lazy hour  
What a good life  
Lying laid back  
Like an old railroad bum by the track  
What a good life  
Living outdoors  
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

"
ABBA,From A Twinkling Star To A Passing Angel,"Twinkle, Twinkle little star  
How I wonder what you are  
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky  
Seems to me you shine your light  
Down to me to say goodnight  
Twinkle, Twinkle my old friend  
Sleep is waiting round the bend  
While you travel through the milky way  
From afar  
Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.  
  
Raindrops on a window pane  
Stillness of a summer rain  
Silently the haze drifts through the trees  
Slowly dawn is breaking through  
Yet a morning without you  
  
Curtins rustling in the breeze  
I'm still trapped within my dreams  
Daylight makes it's way into my mind  
Coming through  
Yet another morning without you.  
  
Finally when darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes backs to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew  
  
Half awake in half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room.  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warms my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room.

"
ABBA,Gimme Gimme Gimme,"Half past twelve  
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone  
How I hate to spend the evening on my own  
Autumn winds  
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room  
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Movie stars  
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win  
It's so different from the world I'm living in  
Tired of T. V.  
I open the window and I gaze into the night  
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

"
ABBA,Givin' A Little Bit More,"There's a gentleness to everything you do  
And it's rubbing off on me I feel it too  
I've been waiting but my loneliness I get  
When you call me on the phone  
And I'm feeling so alone  
When you ask me to come over  
Baby you know I will  
I could never stay on my own  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you

You're my first, you're my last  
Would she care if you lingered  
For another night  
Want to hold you tight  
We could make it right  
  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light  
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right

And I would love to sing my love song  
For you

"
ABBA,Hamlet III,"When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground  
When the air gets cold then I think of us  
Of you and I  
And it almost makes me cry  
So sad and kind of bitter sweet  
And the memories filled with tears  
And I feel my heart will break  
Guess it all was my mistake  
  
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees  
The rain fell softly on your face  
Oh I remember every little thing about that day  
I remember every place  
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds  
The rain fell softly on your face  
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced  
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

ABBA,Happy Hawaii,"Agnetha, Frida Early this morning I drove in the rain  
Out to the airport to get on the plain  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
Alice has been there, she said it was fun  
  
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
After all I had to go through, I'm making no plans  
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance  
  
Guess I've been working a little to hard  
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card  
From Honolulu, a greeting from happy Hawaii  
It's so exciting, why should I pretend  
  
In a few hours the plane will descend  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
I can imagine the beach and the sand  
Walking with someone and holding his hand  
  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
After all I had to go through, I'm making no plans  
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance  
I've got a feeling, the dream will come true  
  
Someone is waiting and I forget you  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii

ABBA,Happy New Year,"No more champagne  
And the fireworks are through  
Here we are, me and you  
Feeling lost and feeling blue  
It's the end of the party  
And the morning seems so grey  
So unlike yesterday  
Now's the time for us to say  
  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don't we might as well lay down and die  
You and I  
  
Sometimes I see  
How the brave new world arrives  
And I see how it thrives  
In the ashes of our lives  
Oh yes, man is a fool  
And he thinks he'll be okay  
Dragging on, feet of clay  
Never knowing he's astray  
Keeps on going anyway  
  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don't we might as well lay down and die  
You and I  
  
Seems to me now  
That the dreams we had before  
Are all dead, nothing more  
Than confetti on the floor  
It's the end of a decade  
In another ten years time  
Who can say what we'll find  
What lies waiting down the line  
In the end of eighty-nine  
  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don't we might as well lay down and die  
You and I

ABBA,He Is Your Brother,"Benny I was a fighter, always looking for trouble  
And my life was so empty, there was nothing to live for  
But then it happened one night  
As I got into a fight  
I could hear someone saying  
As though he was praying  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
On the road  
That we're going  
We all need  
Words of comfort and compassion  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
I was a woman, never thinking of others  
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody  
But then I happened to meet  
A begging man in the street  
As I turned down his praying  
I heard someone saying  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
On the road  
That we're going  
We all need  
Words of comfort and compassion  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another

ABBA,Head Over Heels,"I have a very good friend  
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend  
She has a personal style  
Some people love it others tend to go wild  
You hear her voice everywhere  
Taking the chair  
She's a leading lady  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
  
Her man is one I admire  
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired  
Each time when he speaks his mind  
She pats his head and says that's all very fine  
Exert that will of your own  
When you're alone  
Now we better hurry  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean

And she goes  
Head over heels

"
ABBA,Here We'll Stay,"Love, love is a dream  
We were like two young strands of driftwood  
Caught up in a stream  
We were destined for each other  
From our very first hello  
We came bustin' through that river dam  
And made that river flow  
We will sail upon the ocean  
Til the shoreline meets the sky  
Carried on the first trade wind  
That favours you and I  
We have both of us between us  
Known misfortune in our days  
Darling this time, we're on our way  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
  
Life, oh life is a chance  
We were the only two who spun the wheel  
And never scored romance  
If we'd stayed to play for fortune  
We'd have broke the banks of gold  
We'd have taken old Las Vegas  
For every cent that she could hold  
Love like ours was made in heaven  
It was blessed by Lord above  
We will spend our lives together  
Forever hand in glove  
We have both of us between us  
Known misfortune in our days  
Darling this time, we're on our way  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We won't ever throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
And here we'll stay  
We won't ever throw this love of ours away  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
Here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
So we are here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away...

ABBA,Hey Hey Helen,"So at last you're free  
It's the way you wanted it to be  
And the price you paid  
To become a woman of today  
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry  
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy  
  
Hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen  
Can you make it alone  
(Yes you can)  
  
So you're free at last  
And beginning to forget the past

But you're right, you had to take a second chance  
So you fight to find your freedom

ABBA,Hole In Your Soul,"You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
When it's bad, worse, worst  
(And when you're feeling so bad)  
And you think you're cursed  
(And you've got it sad)  
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
My friend Sam is a chauffeur, Annie goes to school  
Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool  
But on all weekends  
(Together again)  
When I meet my friends  
(I'm gonna see them now)  
And we're lookin' round for the action we sure play it cool  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You paint your world and use all colors  
And then you find it all comes out too bright  
You know it's only a lie  
The songs you sing are too romantic  
And when you want the truth  
They only spit in your eye  
Oh yeah, they're only telling you lies  
Oh yeah, there's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes

ABBA,I Am Just A Girl,"I am just a girl  
One among the others, nothing much to say  
Plain and simple girl  
Not a special type in any way  
Just one look and you will surely see  
That the true Miss Nobody is me  
It's an evil world  
That has only made me a girl  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl  
No one ever looks at in the street  
But today I can't believe it's true  
When you smiled and whispered, I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl  
  
It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone  
And thinking that he'll never look your way  
But then he says he loves you and life has just begun  
It's so much more than any words can say  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet

And you find me beautiful and irresistible  
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
And you feel a strange attraction  
The air is vibrant and electrified  
Welcome to me here I am, my arms are open wide  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
And a million voices blend into a single voice  
And you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets  
People come and take their chances  
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot  
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
People feed me with their lives I have a hungry soul  
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night  
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet  
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light  
Dazzled by the crazy magic  
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf  
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The parks and the squares that you see  
All the sounds that you hear  
And the air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
I am the city  
You let me be  
I am the city  
  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
  
Coming through a cloud  
You're looking at me from above  
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
And you find me beautiful and irresistible  
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
You let me be  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
And a million voices blend into a single voice  
And you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets  
  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
You let me be  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats

ABBA,I Have A Dream,"I have a dream, a song to sing  
To help me cope with anything  
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale  
You can take the future even if you fail  
I believe in angels  
Something good in everything I see  
I believe in angels  
When I know the time is right for me  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
  
I have a dream, a fantasy  
To help me through reality  
And my destination makes it worth the while  
Pushing through the darkness still another mile  
I believe in angels  
Something good in everything I see  
I believe in angels  
When I know the time is right for me  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream

"
ABBA,I Let The Music Speak,"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs  
No poet has ever painted  
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart  
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted  
I let the music speak with no restrains  
I let my feelings take over  
Carry my soul away, into the world  
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  
  
Where my mind is like an open window  
Where the high and healing winds blow  
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me  
I let them take me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn  
Rustling down an old alley  
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man  
In some ancient valley  
I let the music speak, leading me gently  
Urging me like a lover  
Leading me all the way, into a place  
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  
  
Where I'm one with every grand illusion  
No disturbance, no intrusion  
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me  
I let them use me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise  
Or the moment when a day dies  
I surrender without reservation  
No explanation, no questions why  
I take it to me and let it flow through me  
Yes, I let the music speak  
I let the music speak

"
ABBA,I Saw It In The Mirror,"I saw it in the mirror  
I saw it in my face  
That I'm no longer needed  
Anyone can take my place  
I saw it in the mirror  
When I looked into my eyes  
'Cause something sure is wrong  
When this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I saw it in the mirror  
My head is hanging low  
And it ain't too familiar  
With the feelings that I show  
I know you say you love me  
But I'm looking through your lies  
It doesn't really bother you  
If this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I never thought I could cry for you  
But honey, I will miss you  
'Til the day I die  
'Til the day I die  
  
I saw it in the mirror  
I saw it in my face  
That I'm no longer needed  
Anyone can take my place  
I saw it in the mirror  
When I looked into my eyes  
'Cause something sure is wrong  
When this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
This boy cries

ABBA,I Wonder (Departure),"This park and these houses, old streets I have walked  
Everything dear, will it be here  
One day when I am returning?  
My friends will get married, have children and homes  
It sounds so nice, well-planned and wise  
Never expecting surprises  
  
I wonder, it's frightening  
Leaving now, is that the right thing?  
I wonder, it scares me  
But who the the hell am I if I don't leave it  
I'm not a coward  
Oh no, I'll be strong  
One chance in a lifetime  
Yes I will take it, it can't go wrong  
  
My friends and my family, this dull little town  
Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed  
Everything old and familiar

ABBA,If It Wasn't For The Nights,"I got appointments, work I have to do  
Keepin' me so busy all the day through  
They're the things that keep me from thinkin' of you  
Oh baby, I miss you so, I know I'm never gonna make it  
Oh, I'm so restless, I don't care what I say  
And I lose my temper ten times a day  
Still it's even worse when the night's on its way  
It's bad, oh, so bad  
  
Somehow I'd be doin' alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall  
Sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall  
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)  
Somehow I'd be doin' alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
  
No-one to turn to, you know how it is  
I was not prepared for something like this  
Now I see them clearly, the things that I miss  
Oh baby, I feel so bad, I know I'm never gonna make it  
I got my business to help me through the day  
People I must write to, bills I must pay  
But everything's so different when night's on its way  
It's bad, oh, so bad

ABBA,I'm A Marionette,"You're so free  
That's what everybody's tellin' me  
Yet I feel like I'm an outward bound  
Pushed around refuge  
  
Something's wrong  
Got a feeling that I don't belong  
As if I have come from out of space  
Out of place, like King Kong  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'Round and 'round  
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
Like a doll  
Like a puppet with no will at all  
And somebody taught me how to talk  
How to walk, how to fall  
  
Can't complain  
I got no one but myself to blame  
Something's happening, I can't control  
Lost my hold, it's insane  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet

'Round and 'round

Look this way  
Just a little smile is what they say  
You'll look better on the photograph  
If you laugh, that's o.k.!!

ABBA,I've Been Waiting For You,"I, I've been in love before  
I thought I would no more  
Manage to hit the ceiling  
Still, strange as it seems to me  
You brought it back to me  
That old feeling  
  
I, I don't know what you do  
You make me think that you  
Possibly could release me  
I think you'll be able to  
Make all my dreams come true  
And you ease me  
  
You thrill me, you delight me  
You please me, you excite me  
You're something I'd been pleading for  
I love you, I adore you  
I lay my life before you  
I'll have you want me more and more  
And finally it seems my lonely days are through  
I've been waiting for you  
  
I, I'm gonna make you mine  
You're gonna feel so fine  
You'll never want to leave me  
I feel you belong to me  
Someday you will agree  
Please, believe me  
  
You thrill me, you delight me  
You please me, you excite me  
You're something I'd been pleading for  
I love you, I adore you

Oh, I've been waiting for you

There is no mistaking

And you smile and say hello  
Then we'll be dancing through the night  
Knowing everything from there on  
Must be right

And I bet the people gonna like it, yeah  
I know that everybody's gonna shout it  
  
And what a dreadful mighty killer

Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong  
We do the Kong Kong song, gotta sing along  
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom  
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song  
  
Now we can make the jungle out of any old place  
We can make gorillas out of people, yeah  
Well who can tell a monkey from a monkey?  
So people get together, gonna have a good time  
Everybody listen to the music, yeah  
'Cause what we're gonna sing is kinda funky  
  
So let your arms hang down  
And waddle all around

Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
I've had my share of love affairs and they were nothing compared to this  
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Kisses of fire  
Kisses of fire  
  
When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong  
Still it's making me scared that my love is so strong  
Losing you It's a nightmare, babe, and to me it's new  
Never before did you see me begging for more  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning

ABBA,Lay All Your Love On Me,"I wasn't jealous before we met  
Now every woman I see is a potential threat  
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice  
You've heard me saying that  
Smoking was my only vice  
But now it isn't true  
Now everything is new  
And all I've learned has overturned  
I beg of you  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
It was like shooting a sitting duck  
A little smalltalk, a smile  
And baby I was stuck  
I still don't know what  
You've done with me  
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily  
I feel a kind of fear  
When I don't have you near  
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride  
I beg you dear  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
I've had a few little love affairs  
They didn't last very long and  
They've been pretty scarce  
I used to think that was sensible  
It makes the truth  
Even more incomprehensible  
'Cause everything is new  
And everything is you  
And all I've learned has overturned  
What can I do  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me

ABBA,Like An Angel Passing Through My Room,"Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room

ABBA,Love Has It's Ways,"Spring in the air  
The sun was shining  
Still the day was cool  
Saw her waiting for a bus  
As she was going home from school  
  
Looking so cold  
I took her home and  
That was just the start  
We would meet the summer through  
And she was always in my heart  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away  
  
Early that fall  
I knew I loved her  
More than anything  
Gave her everything I had  
She even got a wedding ring  
  
But in the end  
The mind was restless  
And she had to go  
And the love I'd thought would live  
Was buried in the winter snow  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away

ABBA,Love Isn't Easy,"Do you remember the first time, and all of your sweet sweet talk  
Ain't heard it a lot since then love  
Now look at that guy, he's making me cry  
He leaves everybody and he only says goodbye  
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
Darling I know  
  
We gotta have patience  
Love isn't just a sensation  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving love is a reason for living  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
  
From the first moment I saw you I've treated you like a queen  
I've given you lots of presents  
Now listen to that, just look at that cat  
You'd think he was an angel but he's talking through his hat  
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
Darling I know  
  
We gotta have patience  
Love isn't just a sensation  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love is a reason for living  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
  
Patience  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love isn't just a sensation

ABBA,Lovelight,"I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary  
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard  
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing  
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter  
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter  
  
You must have a lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining)  
Maybe even when you're not there (shining)  
The lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
How I remember the first time we went to movie  
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown  
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me  
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter  
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter  
  
You must have a lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining)  
Maybe even when you're not there (shining)  
The lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
And I feel so good  
And I feel so right  
And I know that you must have a lovelight  
  
You've got lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere  
Maybe even when you're not there  
You've got lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
Everything about you is right  
Let it glow and let it be bright  
I don't want to lose your lovelight  
Shining like a star in the night

ABBA,Lovers,"Sit down and listen 'cause I've got good news for you  
It was in the papers today  
Some physician had made a discovery  
This' what she had to say:  
(oooh you know that)  
  
She said that every result she had backed her  
Claiming that love's a longevity factor  
  
So lovers live a little longer, baby  
You and me, we got a chance to live twice  
Lovers live a little longer, ain't that nice  
Lovers live a little longer, baby  
What a feeling when I hold you tight  
Lovers live a little longer, yeah  
  
I can imagine, I'll see in my fantasy  
I'll enjoy every day  
Making love is a dynamite drug, baby  
So why don't we start right away  
(ahh, please don't wait)  
  
I don't care if they're watching 'cause listen  
We've got a reason for each time we're kissing  
  
'cause lovers live a little longer, baby  
You and me, we got a chance to live twice  
Lovers live a little longer, ain't that nice

ABBA,Mamma Mia,"[Chorus]  
Mamma mia, here I go again  
My my, how can I resist you?  
Mamma mia, does it show again  
My my, just how much I've missed you?  
  
Yes, I've been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why, why did I ever let you go?  
Mamma mia, now I really know  
My my, I could never let you go  
I've been angry and sad about things that you do  
I can't count all the times that I've told you ""we're through""  
And when you go, when you slam the door  
I think you know that you won't be away too long  
You know that I'm not that strong  
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring  
One more look and I forget everything  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I've been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why, why did I ever let you go?  
Mamma mia, even if I say  
""Bye bye, leave me now or never""  
Mamma mia, it's a game we play  
""Bye bye"" doesn't mean forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I've been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why, why did I ever let you go?  
Mamma mia, now I really know  
My my, I could never let you go

"
ABBA,Man In The Middle,"Did you see that man in the limousine  
With the pretty doll, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen  
But she doesn't care, and she never will  
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn  
Just as long as he pays the bill  
  
Did you see that man with a fat cigar  
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar  
He can choose the wine from a vintage year  
He will drink champagne in his limousine  
Where the rest of the street can peer  
  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle  
Just like a spider in a cobweb  
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle  
He's never bothered by his conscience  
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be  
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle  
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle)  
  
But you see that man made a big mistake  
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake  
And the money too, all that he can spend  
He can buy the most, nearly anything  
But he can't buy the lot, his friend  
  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle  
Just like a spider in a cobweb  
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle  
He's never bothered by his conscience  
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be  
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle  
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle)

ABBA,Me And Bobby And Bobby's Brother,"Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
I remember all the games we used to play  
I really do  
And I went to see them almost everyday  
I wanted to  
Though we quarreled at times and had a few fights  
We were the best of friends  
We found a place in the sun  
A heaven of fun  
  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Wildest kids you could see  
We could play together, climbing the apple tree  
Yes, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
They would take me out for football games and such  
They liked to play  
And I guess I didn't like it very much  
But anyway  
I was happy and proud to be with the boys  
Being a little girl  
I found a place in the sun  
A heaven of fun  
  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Wildest kids you could see  
We could play together, climbing the apple tree

ABBA,Me And I,"Sometimes when I'm mad  
There's a part of me that seems to be a little sad  
Sometimes when I scream  
There's a voice in me that says, ""You shouldn't be so mean""  
Oh no, oh no  
Part of me is acting while the other stands beside  
Yes, I am to myself what Jekyll must have been to Hyde  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I  
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique  
Think about yourself for a minute  
And you'll find the answer in it  
Everyone's a freak  
  
Sometimes I have toyed  
With ideas that I got from good old Dr Freud  
Nothing new of course  
It may seem to you I try to break through open doors  
Oh no, oh no  
I just want to say a lot of that applies to me  
'Cause it's an explanation to my split identity  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I  
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique  
Think about yourself for a minute

ABBA,Midnight Special,"Well, you wake up in the morning  
Hear the ding-dong ring  
You go marching to the table  
See the same old thing  
See the fork on the table  
Nothing in your pan  
If you sing a thing about it  
You're in trouble with the man  
  
Let the midnight special shine a light on me  
Let the midnight special shine it's ever loving light on me  
  
If you ever go to houston  
Well, you better act right  
And you better not gamble  
And you better not fight  
For the sheriff will arrest you  
Then he'll take you down  
And before you understand it  
You are prison bound  
  
Let the midnight special  
Shine a light on me  
Let the midnight special  
Shine it's ever loving light on me  
On me, on me

ABBA,Money Money Money,"I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay  
Ain't it sad  
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me  
That's too bad  
In my dreams I have a plan  
If I got me a wealthy man  
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball...  
  
Money, money, money  
Must be funny  
In the rich man's world  
Money, money, money  
Always sunny  
In the rich man's world  
Aha-ahaaa  
All the things I could do  
If I had a little money  
It's a rich man's world  
  
A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind  
Ain't it sad  
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me  
That's too bad  
So I must leave, I'll have to go  
To Las Vegas or Monaco  
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...  
  
Money, money, money  
Must be funny  
In the rich man's world  
Money, money, money  
Always sunny  
In the rich man's world

ABBA,Move On,"They say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul.  
A voyager, ad a settler, they both have a distant goal.  
If I explore the heavens, or if I search inside.  
Well, it really doesn't matter as long as I can tell myself  
I've always tried.  
  
Like a roller in the ocean, life is motion  
Move on  
Like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing  
Move on  
Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning  
Move on  
How I treasure every minute  
Being part of it, being in it  
With the urge to move on  
  
I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind  
It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time  
And somewhere lies the answer  
To all the questions why  
What really makes the difference  
Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive  
  
Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)

How I treasure every minute (la la la la)  
Being part of it (la la la la)  
Being in it (la la la la)  
With the urge to move on  
  
The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea  
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me  
I see it and I hear it  
But how can I explain  
The wonder of the moment  
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain  
  
Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)

How I treasure every minute (la la la la)  
Being part of it (la la la la-ah)  
Being in it  
With the urge to move on  
  
La la la la la la-la, la la la la la la-la, la la la la-la

Never again we two  
Never again, nothing I can do  
  
Like an image passing by, my love, my life  
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
Answer me sincerely  
Was it a dream, a lie  
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life

So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life

Then I did what she had told me  
Dying for my friend to hold me  
Ooh, my mama said, ""Try and get one thing into your head""  
My mama said, ""Pa and me, we give you room and bed""  
How I want to live my life

ABBA,"Nina, Pretty Ballerina","Every day in the morning on her way to the office  
You can see as she catches a train  
Just a face among a million faces  
Just another woman with no name  
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special  
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree  
'Cause I know she's got a little secret  
Friday evening she turns out to be  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play  
But she knows the fun would go away  
If she would play it every day  
  
So she's back every morning to her work at the office  
And another week to live in a dream  
And another row of early mornings  
In an almost never-ending stream  
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain  
Everybody seems to think she's a bore  
But they wouldn't know her little secret  
What her Friday night would have in store  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way

ABBA,On And On And On,"I was at a party  
And this feller said to me  
Something bad is happening  
I'm sure you do agree  
People care for nothing  
No respect for human rights  
Evil times are coming  
We are in for darker nights?  
I said who are you  
To talk about impending doom?  
He got kinda wary  
As he looked around the room  
He said, I'm a minister  
A big shot in the state?  
I said I just can't  
Believe it, boy  
I think it's great  
Brother can you tell me  
What is right and what is wrong?  
He said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone  
  
Over in the corner  
I could see this other guy  
He was kinda flirty  
He was giving me the eye  
So I took advantage  
Of the fact that I'm a star  
Shook my hair and took  
A casual stroll up to the bar  
And as sure as hell  
This guy was coming up to me  
He said, who am I and  
Who are you and who are we  
What's our situation do  
We have some time for us?  
I said, I was not exactly  
Waiting for the bus  
He said, if you're going  
Somewhere can I come along?  
I said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone

ABBA,"One Man, One Woman","No smiles, not a single word at the breakfast table  
Though I would have liked to begin  
So much that I want to say, but I feel unable  
You leave and you slam the door  
Like you've done many times before  
And I cry and I feel so helpless  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
Outside I can see the sun trough the open window  
Inside everything feel so cold  
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go  
Somethimes when I just can't cope  
I cling to a desperate hope  
And I cry and I feel like dying  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up  
The sound of a key in the door  
You smile and I realize that we need a shake up  
Our love is a precious thing  
Worth the pain and the suffering  
And it's never too late for changin'  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
You and me till' the end

ABBA,One Of Us,"They passed me by, all of those great romances  
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances  
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy  
And so I dealt you the blow  
One of us had to go  
Now it's different, I want you to know  
  
One of us is crying  
One of us is lying  
In her lonely bed  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all  
  
I saw myself as a concealed attraction  
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action  
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving  
That's how I started the show  
One of us had to go  
Now I've changed and I want you to know  
  
One of us is crying  
One of us is lying  
In her lonely bed  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all  
Never left at all  
  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call

ABBA,Our Last Summer,"The summer air was soft and warm  
The feeling right, the Paris night  
Did it's best to please us  
And strolling down the Elysee  
We had a drink in each cafe  
And you  
You talked of politics, philosophy and I  
Smiled like Mona Lisa  
We had our chance  
It was a fine and true romance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
  
We made our way along the river  
And we sat down in the grass  
By the Eiffel tower  
I was so happy we had met  
It was the age of no regret  
Oh yes  
Those crazy years, that was the time  
Of the flower-power  
But underneath we had a fear of flying  
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying  
We took the chance  
Like we were dancing our last dance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day, worries far away  
Our last summer  
We could laugh and play  
  
And now you're working in a bank  
The family man, the football fan  
And your name is Harry  
How dull it seems  
Are you the hero of my dreams  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day, worries far away...

ABBA,People Need Love,"People need hope, people need lovin'  
People need trust from a fellow man  
People nee love to make a good livin'  
People need faith in a helping hand  
  
Man has alway wanted a woman by his side  
To keep him company  
Women always knew that it takes a man to get  
Matrimony and harmony  
Everybody knows that a man who's feeling down  
Wants some female company  
Gotta have love to carry on living  
Gotta have love 'til eternity

Like a woman needs a man  
If a man's in love and his woman wants the moon  
Then he'll take it down if he can  
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares  
Isn't that what you call a friend  
Gotta have love to carry on living  
Isn't it easy to understand  
  
People need hope, people need lovin'  
People need trust from a fellow man  
People nee love to make a good livin'

Saddle your horse my dear  
And ride off into the sunset  
You'd better go  
For there is no  
Place for you here  
Like and old fashioned hero  
You stand before me  
You think our life is a movie  
My world is real  
I live and feel  
And I can do without you  
Put on your white sombrero  
Your red bandana too  
Think of this day as a showdown  
Goodbye my friend  
This is the end  
For me and you  
Now be a bold vacquero  
Don't show your feelings  
I'll cry while you're disappearing  
Into the night  
All dressed in white  
Unchained and free without me  
Put on your white sombrero  
Like all the cowboys do  
Go find a sweet senorita  
Somebody meek  
Who'll never speak  
Harshly to you  
You're such a cavaliero  
Proud, never bending  
I want someone who will take me  
Just as I am  
I need a man  
Who is in rhyme  
With his time  
You'll never take me  
Just as I am  
I need a man  
Who is in rhyme  
With his time

Dig in the dancing queen  
  
Friday night and the lights are low  
Looking out for a place to go  
Where they play the right music  
Getting in the swing  
You come to look for a king  
Anybody could be that guy  
Night is young and the music's high  
With a bit of rock music  
Everything is fine  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet  
Only seventeen  
Dancing queen  
Feel the beat from the tambourine

See that girl  
Watch that scene  
Dig in the dancing queen

Leave 'em burning and then you're gone

ABBA,Should I Laugh Or Cry,"Frida  
He stands  
Towering over me beside my bed  
Losing his head  
  
Tells me  
I must take him seriously  
Droning on the usual way  
He's such a clever guy  
  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
He's dressed  
In the striped pyjamas that I bought  
  
Trousers too short  
Gives me  
On his small philosophy  
Carries on the way he does  
  
And me I get so tired  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
Agnetha, Frida  
  
High and mighty, his banner flies  
A fool's pride in his eyes  
Standing there on his toes  
To grow in size  
  
All I see is a big balloon  
Halfway up to the moon  
He's wrapped up in the warm  
And save cocoon  
  
Of an eternal lie  
So should I laugh or cry  
Frida  
Strange how  
  
Dangerously indifferent I have grown  
Cold as a stone  
No more  
Pain as there was pain before  
  
Far away he rambles on  
I feel my throat go dry  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry

He's wrapped up in the warm  
  
And save cocoon  
Of an eternal lie  
So should I laugh or cry

Looking down at people passing by  
Sitting here no-one can harm me  
They just stare at me and wonder why  
No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here  
Whatever happens, I won't let no-one near  
Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
And in the evening, when the sun goes down  
I'll be the bluest of men in this town  
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Waiting for those little words from you  
People laugh and point their fingers  
Like I was a monkey at the zoo  
But I will stay here, among my coconuts  
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got  
Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window  
Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Feeling angry at the silly crowd  
No-one else but you can calm me  
You should know by now I'm far too proud  
I need to show you, I've got my feelings too  
You shouldn't treat me like you always do  
So won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now

ABBA,Slipping Through My Fingers,"Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning  
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile  
I watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness  
And I have to sit down for a while  
The feeling that I'm losing her forever  
And without really entering her world  
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter  
That funny little girl  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table  
Barely awake I let precious time go by  
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling  
And a sense of guilt I can't deny  
What happened to the wonderful adventures  
The places I had planned for us to go  
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't  
And why, I just don't know  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture  
And save it from the funny tricks of time  
(Slipping through my fingers)  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning  
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile

Or is this just a fantasy  
Is it true that the beast is waking  
Stirring in his restless sleep tonight  
In the pale moonlight  
  
In the grip of this cold December  
You and I have reason to remember  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I don't sing  
They blow their horns and march along  
They drum their drums and look so strong  
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance  
  
What's that sound, what's that dreadful rumble  
Won't somebody tell me what I hear  
In the distance, but drawing near  
Is it only a storm approaching  
All that thunder and the blinding light  
In the winter night  
  
In the grip of this cold December  
You and I have reason to remember  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I don't sing  
They blow their horns and march along  
They drum their drums and look so strong  
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way

ABBA,SOS,"And when I see the sign that points one way  
The lot we used to pass by every day  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
You're not to blame  
  
From deep inside the tears I forced to cry  
From deep inside the pain I chose to hide  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
For me it cries  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
For me it cries  
  
Your name and mine inside a heart upon a wall  
Still find a way to haunt me  
Though they're so small  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
You're not to blame

ABBA,Summer Night City,"Summer night city  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
In the sun I feel like sleeping  
I can't take it for too long  
My impatience slowly creeping  
Up my spine and going strong  
I know what's waiting there for me  
Tonight I'm loose and fancy free  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From that giant dynamo  
Lots to take and lots to give  
Time to breathe and time to live  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
It's elusive call it glitter  
Somehow something turns me on  
Some folks only see the litter  
We don't miss them when they're gone  
I love the feeling in the air  
My kind of people everywhere  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From this giant dynamo  
And tomorrow when it's dawning  
And the first birds starts to sing  
In the pale light of the morning  
Nothing's worth remembering  
  
It's a dream it's out of reach  
Scattered driftwood on the beach  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city

But you'd better  
  
Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around  
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around  
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure  
So get off our playground and stay away

Suzy went home to Mama's arms  
Mama said ""Look, she's never done you no harm  
So get off her back and let her be  
Why can't you play together in harmony?""  
We really didn't know what to say  
But as soon as she went away  
We laughed and said

ABBA,Thank You For The Music,"I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore  
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before  
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing  
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing  
I'm so grateful and proud  
All I want is to sing it out loud  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be?  
Without a song or a dance what are we?  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
  
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk  
She says I began to sing long before I could talk  
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?  
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart  
Like a melody can?  
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be?  
Without a song or a dance what are we?  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
  
I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair  
I wanna sing it out to everybody  
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty

ABBA,That's Me,"Are you sure you want to hear more  
What if I ain't worth the while  
Not the style you'd be looking for  
If I'm sweet tonight  
Things look different in the morning light  
I'm jealous and I'm proud  
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
Are you sure you want to hear more  
Would I be the one you seek  
Mild and meek like the girl next door  
Don't you realize  
I may be an angel in disguise  
It's lonely to be free  
But I'm not a man's toy, I'll never be  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
I don't believe in fairy-tales  
Sweet nothings in my ear  
But I do believe in sympathy  
That's me, you see  
  
Are you sure you want to hear more  
Won't you have a drink with me  
Just to see you're not really sore  
I can't help my ways  
I'm just not the girl to hide my face  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
There's a special love  
Like an eagle flying with a dove  
I'll find it in the end  
If I keep on searching, but until then  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me

ABBA,The Day Before You Came,"I must have left my house at eight, because I always do  
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due  
I must have read the morning paper going into town  
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned  
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine  
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed  
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so  
The usual place, the usual bunch  
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained  
The day before you came  
  
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two  
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue  
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day  
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away  
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule  
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school  
The train back home again  
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then  
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame  
The day before you came  
  
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so  
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go  
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV  
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see  
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then  
I must have read a while  
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style  
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim  
The day before you came  
  
And turning out the light  
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain  
The day before you came

ABBA,The King Has Lost His Crown,"I believe your new girl turned you down  
And they say she's pushin' you around  
How does it feel, I guess it hurts your pride  
Tell me my friend how many nights you've cried  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The king has lost his crown  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown  
  
Was it hard to step down from your throne  
And to know tonight you're all alone  
Oh what a shame, you really want that girl  
She doesn't care, still you just dream of her  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The king has lost his crown  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The word is all around  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown

ABBA,The Name Of The Game,"I've seen you twice, in a short time  
Only a week since we started  
It seems to me, for every time  
I'm getting more open-hearted  
  
I was an impossible case  
No-one ever could reach me  
But I think I can see in your face  
There's a lot you can teach me  
So I wanna know  
  
What's the name of the game?  
Does it mean anything to you?  
What's the name of the game?  
Can you feel it the way I do?  
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know  
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow  
  
And you make me talk  
And you make me feel  
And you make me show  
What I'm trying to conceal  
If I trust in you, would you let me down?  
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?  
Could you feel the same way too?  
I wanna know  
  
The name of the game  
  
I have no friends, no-one to see  
And I am never invited  
Now I am here, talking to you  
No wonder I get excited  
  
Your smile, and the sound of your voice  
And the way you see through me  
Got a feeling, you give me no choice  
But it means a lot to me  
So I wanna know  
  
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)  
Does it mean anything to you? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)  
(But it means a lot)

ABBA,The Piper,"They came from the hills  
And they came from the valleys and the plains  
They struggled in the cold  
In the heat and the snow and in the rain  
Came to hear him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
Sub luna saltamus  
  
They came from the south  
From the west and the north and from the east  
They waited for the man  
Like a parish is waiting for the priest  
Longed to hear him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
Sub luna saltamus  
  
He gave them a dream  
He seduced everybody in the land  
The fire in his eyes  
And the fear was a weapon in his hand  
So they let him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
  
And we dance beneath the moon

ABBA,The Visitors,"I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me  
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence  
I cannot move, I'm standing  
Numb and frozen  
Among the things I love so dearly  
The books, the paintings and the furniture  
Help me  
  
The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the door-knob  
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient  
And they don't dare to come here  
Anymore now  
But how I loved our secret meetings  
We talked and talked in quiet voices  
Smiling  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
Crackin' up  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
Crackin' up  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up  
  
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation  
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces  
And now they've come to take me  
Come to break me  
And yet it isn't unexpected  
I have been waiting for these visitors  
Help me  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building

ABBA,The Way Old Friends Do,"You and I can share the silence  
Finding comfort together  
The way old friends do  
  
And after fights and words of violence  
We make up with each other  
The way old friends do  
  
Times of joy and times of sorrow  
We will always see it through

ABBA,The Winner Takes It All,"I don't want to talk  
About the things we've gone through  
Though it's hurting me  
Now it's history  
I've played all my cards  
And that's what you've done too  
Nothing more to say  
No more ace to play  
  
The winner takes it all  
The loser standing small  
Beside the victory  
That's my destiny  
  
I was in your arms  
Thinking I belonged there  
I figured it made sense  
Building me a fence  
Building me a home  
Thinking I'd be strong there  
But I was a fool  
Playing by the rules  
  
The gods may throw a dice  
Their minds as cold as ice  
And someone way down here  
Loses someone dear  
The winner takes it all  
The loser has to fall  
It's simple and it's plain  
Why should I complain.  
  
But tell me does she kiss  
Like I used to kiss you?  
Does it feel the same  
When she calls your name?  
Somewhere deep inside  
You must know I miss you  
But what can I say  
Rules must be obeyed  
  
The judges will decide  
The likes of me abide  
Spectators of the show  
Always staying low  
The game is on again  
A lover or a friend  
A big thing or a small  
The winner takes it all  
  
I don't want to talk  
If it makes you feel sad  
And I understand  
You've come to shake my hand  
I apologize  
If it makes you feel bad  
Seeing me so tense  
No self-confidence  
But you see  
The winner takes it all  
The winner takes it all

Never walk alone after midnight  
If you don't believe it you better beware  
Of me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger

Look around the corner and try not to scream  
It's me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger

I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
  
The city is a prison, you never escape  
You're forever trapped in the alleys  
Look into the shadows and you'll see the shape  
Of me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights  
Yellow eyes, the spotlight of the city nights  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
And if I meet you, what if I eat you, I am the tiger  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger

Bee Gees,Big Chance,"People in their pride believe it's easier for them to leave  
Their problems in the arms of others, running to their mothers  
Lasting love is such a funny thing  
When you're in love you're on the wings  
You're not in love, it's good for you  
'cause you can do the things you want to do  
  
It's you big chance, to take it baby  
It's you big chance, you'll make it baby  
  
When you're high and mighty you'll remember how I loved you  
You'll be thinkin' how you hurt me when I needed you beside me  
In the night is such a lonely time  
I dream of you and that's a sign  
It means that I am still a fool  
And I am still so much in love with you  
  
It's your big chance, so take it baby  
It's your big chance, don't fake it baby  
  
Big chance  
Hot chance

Bee Gees,Birdie Told Me,"Birdie told me I must get over you somehow.  
And she told me never to think of you right now.  
But it's hopeless to say how can I forget the way she used to love me.  
I think about her in my time, know in my mind it's over.  
  
Looks like falling, heaven is calling my name to me.  
Funny faces loving the traces left for me.  
But it's hopeless to say how can I forget the way she used to love me.  
I think about her in my time, know in my mind it's over.

Anyone can be a star  
Brighter than the lightning

You got to be what you know  
  
There may be somebody out to get the better of you

But you don't get enough to eat  
Walking on a wire  
There is a future unknown  
Nobody does it alone  
  
And maybe you can be the thunder  
If you follow your dream  
There must be one good woman to show you the way  
Don't let them make you feel you're less than you are  
Remember , somebody calls you on the telephone line  
And all the world gets crazy and you win this time

Bee Gees,Charade,"1974  
Some nights we made our love in the sand  
And at the tide we held our love in our hands  
And we listened to music the ocean was playing  
The words that our two hearts were saying  
That only two lovers can make  
Let us ride on the wind while this moment is real  
  
Your the light of my life  
You are welcome to my Charade  
And this felling knowing you blessed me forever  
  
And believing I have been touch by your love  
And the pleasure of knowing the evening won't tare us apart  
  
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone  
We can gaze up the sky till the night is over  
  
Light of my life  
You are welcome to my Charade  
And this felling knowing you blessed me forever  
  
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone  
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over  
  
Light of my life  
You are welcome to my Charade  
  
And this feeling knowing you blassed me forever  
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone  
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over  
Light of my life  
You are welcome to my Charade...

Bee Gees,Close Another Door,"Many years have passed, it seems,  
And I am all alone.  
I've sent the children far away  
To some obscure unknown.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
It's so sad,  
So sad.  
Close another door.  
Listen to my eyes.  
Close another door.  
You're much too old to work,  
So won't you run away?  
  
When I was young, I used to say  
That age won't bother me.  
The life I had was very sad,  
It all went out to sea

And though the sun is in outside,  
The rain is in my hair.  
Now my life is lived inside,  
(Now all my life is mystified)  
My home is in my chair.

Let me go.  
Send me flowers and  
Put me on a plane.

Done found yourself a ma and pa

With a pencil in his hand he will travel on as planned  
With a mere step in the mountain to a light  
  
Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way  
Oh, they don't know where he is  
Very very nice, very very nice  
  
Even in the morning when he slept  
Something odd is missing  
There's nothing very much to talk about  
And nothing very much to see

Oh, they don't know where he is  
Very very nice, very very nice  
  
Talks about the place he'd like to go  
And you never see the worrying and hurrying that makes a person slow  
Yet, you wouldn't think he'd be so hard to find  
Yet, he looks so very busy but there's nothing on his mind  
And his wavy hair continues not to grow

She was everything I dreamed she'd be.  
Sweet surender, what a night!  
  
I felt the rush at the rolling balls of thunder.  
Spinning my head around and taking my body under,  
Oh what a night!  
  
Why'd it take so long to see the light.  
Seemed so wrong, but now it seemed so right.  
What a lady, what a night!

If you give it all away  
Make it mine.  
  
You are desire  
Everything you need, I give you right or wrong  
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on  
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light  
  
You are desire  
Everything you need, I give you right or wrong  
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on  
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light

"
Bee Gees,Dimensions,"Hindsight, don't make it right  
She give me trouble enough  
And she's a ball of light  
I'm in the tunnel of love  
With the American dream  
And I was born too soon  
A little good luck, never stuck  
She got me climbing the walls  
Got me hard as a rock  
Within a city of sin, she got a city block  
And she was barkin' at the moon  
  
She likes to show  
So many sides to her  
And I'd be the one to know  
  
[Chorus:]  
When am I gonna go to your dimension  
When am I gonna go to where you are  
When am I gonna go to your dimension  
Dimensions of each other keep us goin' strong  
  
Black knight, take a bite  
She can double it up  
And she's a way of life  
And whether dead or alive  
She got a fix on me  
And I was dancin' in the fire  
White steam, never seen  
In every muscle and bone  
She was a love machine  
And she could wrestle me down  
And get a taste of me  
In her web of desire  
  
She changed my world  
How can the body know  
It's touchin' me or her  
  
[Chorus]

"
Bee Gees,Dogs,"1974  
I was hungry and I was cold , had a father far too old  
Couldn't make it to the place he'd like to be  
In a tree trunk in the park , he was living in the dark  
Keeping other dogs like him for company  
  
In the evening I'd go down to a nightclub in the town  
Try to get some bread to make another way  
Back to the park I'd go , dig him out of the snow  
You know he's lived a thousand years day to day  
  
Well , the days get shorter and the nights get longer  
And you never learn to know  
If you love one another , could you look at each other  
Could it ever really show  
And at this moment in time you couldn't make up your mind  
Now could you ever understand  
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea  
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end  
When I'm long dead and gone will your love for me go on  
Will I be the one you run to in the end  
And all my dogs need a friend  
  
It was a quarter to three in the summer of '73  
When I heard somebody call outside my door  
Said ""Are you friend or are you foe""  
He looked up and he said ""no, but I'd like to come inside and know you more""  
  
Well the days get shorter and the nights get longer  
And you never learn to know  
If you love one another , could you look at each other  
Could it ever really show  
And at this moment in time you couldn't make up your mind  
Now could you ever understand  
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea  
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end  
When I'm long dead and gone will your love for me go on  
Will I be the one you run to in the end  
And all my dogs need a friend  
  
Need a friend  
Need a friend

"
Bee Gees,Don't Forget To Remember,"Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me  
I keep telling my self that it's true  
I can get over anything you want my love  
But I can't get myself over you  
  
Don't forget to remember me  
And the love that used to be  
I still remember you  
I love you  
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above  
Don't forget to remember me my love  
  
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl  
Though I try to forget you somehow  
You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole  
Let me try to go on living right now  
  
Don't forget to remember me  
And the love that used to be  
I still remember you  
I love you  
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above  
Don't forget to remember me my love

"
Bee Gees,Don't Throw It All Away,"Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why  
But lately you don't talk to me  
Darling I can't see me in your eyes  
I hold you near but you're so far away  
And it's losing you I can't believe  
To watch you leave and let this feeling die  
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive  
And tomorrow if I'm here without your love  
You know I can't survive  
Only my love can raise you high above it all  
  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
  
(break)  
  
We can take the darkness and make if full of light  
But let your love flow back to me  
How can you leave and let this feeling die  
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone  
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on  
No other women's love could be as true, I'm begging you  
  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
  
We changed the world we made it ours to hold  
But dreams are made for those who really try  
This losing you is real  
But I still feel you here inside  
  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love

Bee Gees,Don't Wanna Live Inside Myself,"I am the searcher of my fortunes  
I've got my right hand on the wheel  
We've got to dig for buried treasures  
I know exactly how i feel  
  
I went walkin'through a grave-yard  
Where the darkness is my friend  
I heard all about the beginning  
I want to see just where it ends  
  
I have fed the jaded tiger  
And every tiger knows my name  
But just as long as long as i can see my face  
I can tell myself my name  
  
Don't want to live inside myself  
I'm much better of alone  
But then you must believe in the fallin'rain  
In the morning  
  
Bury me down by the river  
Saved by the bell  
Man for all seasons

Bee Gees,Down The Road,"1974  
I don't need anybody . I don't need anyone.  
Take it nice and easy mama , chicken on the run and I don't care.  
I'd show my body anywhere.  
Ain't no big city winner's gonna pass my buck anywhere.  
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care.  
  
Go down to the courthouse and I've been on display.  
Don't you think that I don't know  
it ain't been a perfect day , but I don't care.  
I'd sell my body anywhere.  
In the name of creation , I can't find an explanation anywhere.  
Ain't no easy rider gonna settle my luck and I don't care  
  
Down , down the road , up the road  
Down , down the road , up the road  
  
Been rejuvenated to the highest degree.  
Ain't no words describing what this feeling's done to me and I don't care.  
I'd show my feelings anywhere.  
Ain't no heavy Mister Leather's gonna paddle my butt anywhere  
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care.

Bee Gees,Evolution,"There's a law in what we do  
We got a quest for something new  
Everything you witness seems to  
Let you down  
If someone gets you from behind  
I got an open mind  
And you've been thirsty for the friend you found  
  
Close your eyes and make a wish  
I don't wanna mess with mother nature  
Knowing that you're mine  
You said I could see  
You with another and we all get satisfied  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a form of evolution  
It's a kind of movin' on  
An eternal source of pleasure  
In being the one  
When your love is for the giving  
It's a case of destiny  
You know we look for the same insane games  
Got to be commital to be a little deviation  
  
So I get all wound up inside  
I can see your scene unwind  
You dance together or you dance alone  
And leave the real world in the air  
Love it in leather I don't care  
Everything is legal in the danger zone  
  
Close your eyes and make a wish  
Later we could cater to the animal  
Knowing that you're mine  
It's straight in my face  
You and your lover and the brain is paralyzed  
  
It's a form of evolution  
It's a kind of movin' on  
It's a cycle of emotion  
In being the one  
In the storm of revolution  
What is done can be undone  
You know we look for the same insane games  
Got to be committal  
To the subtle variations  
  
It's a form of evolution  
It's a kind of movin' on  
It's a cycle of emotion  
In being the one  
If your love is for the givin'  
It's a case of destiny  
And you can find your source of pleasure  
In being with me

With the light by the window.  
Out in the jungle of life she was  
Yearning to go.  
  
All of the years I've been there for the tears  
She will sell you.  
Out in the city she search for the face  
That she knew.  
  
Did you believe that a love so alive could be over?

Oh oh oh,

Tonight, lonely tonight.  
Lonely tonight.  
  
Fool is the father who clings to the  
Child he is losing.  
Mother too weary to question  
The wisdom of youth.  
  
There with your head in your handa  
As you pray to her picture.  
Out in the rain she would search  
For somebody to hold.  
  
Did you believe you could find  
What you need with a stranger?

No matter how strong

Learn how to use that muscle  
Take a little chance will get you

Living at the speed of light  
Gotta make your heart beat faster  
You gotta climb inside  
Set that spirit free  
  
Fight the good fight  
Fingers to the bone  
Gotta take a stand  
And save this land of liberty  
Stumble on the ground that shakes you  
Push it to the point that breaks you  
Little bit of fire it gives you  
Soul of a winner  
Help you bring them to their knees  
  
In the face of the foe  
Never let em drag you under  
Don't you wanna leave behind ya  
A legacy  
Catch another streak of lightning  
By the God of fire and thunder  
Battle in the name of the nation  
Making history  
  
Fight the good fight  
Fingers to the bone  
Gotta take a stand  
And save this land of liberty  
And brother when you're down to zero  
Everybody needs that hero  
Gotta be a star to follow  
All the way there  
And all the way home

Bee Gees,First Of May,"When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall,  
We used to love while others used to play.  
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by,  
Some one else moved in from far away.

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small,  
And you don't ask the time of day.  
But you and I, our love will never die,  
But guess we'll cry come first of May.  
  
The apple tree that grew for you and me,  
I watched the apples falling one by one.  
And I recall the moment of them all,  
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine.

But lips are never enough to get you through.  
You stole my nights and you got your way,  
Now you got me dying inside, oh baby.  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
Listen to what I say.  
Pick up the pieces of my life

Open the pages of my life.

I'm not living my life over you.  
Some satisfaction you get if you dare  
But is it ever enough to get you through?

You learn how to cry, you learn how to cry.

Listen to what I say (ooh),  
Pick up the pieces of my life into the night of day (ooh).

Bee Gees,For Whom The Bell Tolls,"I stumble in the night  
Never really knew what it would've been like  
You're no longer there to break my fall  
The heartache over you  
I'd give it everything but I couldn't live through  
I never saw the signs  
You're the last to know when love is blind  
  
All the tears and the turbulent years  
When I would not wait for no-one  
Didn't stop and take a look at myself  
And see me losing you  
  
[Chorus:]  
When the lonely heart breaks  
It's the one that forsakes  
It's the dream that we stole  
And I'm missing you more  
Than the fire that will roar  
There's a hole in my soul  
For you it's goodbye  
For me it's to cry  
For whom the bell tolls  
  
Seen you in a magazine  
A picture at a party where you shouldn't have been  
Hanging on the arm of someone else  
I'm still in love with you  
Won't you come back to your little boy blue  
I've come to feel inside  
This precious love was never mine  
  
Now I know but a little too late  
That I could not live without you  
In the dark or the broad daylight  
I promise I'll be there

Now I know there'll be times like this  
When I couldn't reach out to no-one  
Am I never gonna find someone  
Who knows me like you do  
Are you leaving me a helpless child  
When it took so long to save me  
Fight the devil and the deep blue sea  
I'll follow you anywhere  
I promise I'll be there

Want to live all my life around you  
You're my light in a world of sorrow  
Scared of losing this dream tomorrow

Needing you beside me , together , no never

I lose the love that has always freed me  
Not knowing angel , what's coming after  
Never hearing you're golden laughter  
Oh my baby , hearts like thunder  
Can't escape from the spell I'm under  
I surrender to all your treasure  
Endless nights of pain and pleasure  
I just want to hold you , forever , forever

Bee Gees,Gilbert Green,"On a hill, inside a house in Covewell Reach  
Stands a man who's feeling very tired  
Looking at a song he wrote some time ago  
Could have made it big inside a Broadway show  
  
Every day I go away and find ideas  
Think I'll climb on top of somewhere high  
Couldn't I write a song about a man who's dead?  
Didn't really know if he was off his head  
  
Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes  
Too bad for Gilbert Green  
We can tell the world that he was right  
  
Sitting in his attic on a sunny day  
Mending fifty goblets that are worn  
Humming to himself a song of yesteryear  
His hearing wasn't good but his eyes were clear  
  
Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes  
Too bad for Gilbert Green  
We can tell the world that he was right  
  
Now the house is burnt, along with Gilbert Green  
Sad to see his sisters stand and cry  
And in the basement lies a song that wasn't seen  
Tells the tale of laughing men and yellow beans

Too bad for Gilbert Green  
Now we can tell the world that he was right

Come and walk one more mile  
Now for once in your life you're alone  
But you ain't got a dime  
There's no time for the phone  
  
I've just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on, hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on, hold on  
  
I told him I'm in no hurry  
But if I broke her heart  
Then won't you tell her I'm sorry  
And for once in my life I'm alone  
And I've gotta let her know  
Just in time before I go  
  
I've just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on, hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on, hold on  
  
Well I laughed but that didn't work  
And it's only her love  
That keeps me wearing this dirt  
Now I'm crying but deep down inside  
Well I did it to him  
Now it's my turn to die  
  
I've just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on, hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on, hold on  
  
I've just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on, hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on, hold on

Bee Gees,Grease,"I saw my problems and I'll see the light  
We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right  
There ain't no danger we can go too far  
We start believin' now that we can be who we are, grease is the word  
  
They think our love is just a growin' pain  
Why don't they understand? It's just a cryin' shame  
Their lips are lyin', only real is real  
We stop the fight right now, we got to be what we feel, grease is the word  
  
(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)  
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning  
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion  
Grease is the way we are feeling  
  
We take the pressure, and we throw away conventionality, belongs to yesterday  
There is a chance that we can make it so far  
We start believin' now that we can be who we are, grease is the word  
  
This is a life of illusion, a life of control  
Mixed with confusion - what're we doin' here?  
  
We take the pressure, and we throw away conventionality, belongs to yesterday  
There is a chance that we can make it so far  
We start believin' now that we can be who we are, grease is the word

I've given all my love away and I've been left with none

Bee Gees,Happy Ever After,"Though I know it's time to take you home,  
Baby, you and I are all alone.  
We could take a moment of our own  
And look what we've got.  
  
You could destroy this heart of mine.  
I'm only trying to get by,  
Hiding in the shadows of the night,  
Holding you and knowing the wrong is right.  
  
Show me some mercy.  
You know what you're doing is making me a happy man.  
I shield you from the rain.  
I've been slow to get you but I'm working as hard as I can.  
  
This time, it's what we believe is true.  
And whether you believe I'm in love with you  
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean.  
  
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen?  
And all the years of tears and laughter  
We could go through,  
Will it be happy ever after  
For me and you? Ooh. Ah.  
  
Heaven is a place inside of me  
Living with your heart as company.  
Only you can change the way I feel  
And make it feel good.  
  
Where there is love there is no crime.  
I'm only trying to get mine.  
Let me be the one to dry your eyes.  
We can be the promise that never dies.  
  
Light of an angel,  
Blinded by the vision I'm wishing we could travel on.  
Stay with me, baby,  
Any less than an hour you be leaving me lonely too long.  
  
This time, it's what we believe is true.  
And whether you believe I'm in love with you.  
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean.

Bee Gees,Haunted House,"I know baby's bad for my self-esteem.  
Find another face for your sympathy.  
Some of us cry, some of them lie,  
but no one sees inside.  
  
The spark of baby's eyes and I turn to stone.  
Maybe I can't survive in the danger zone.  
Sounds of the night.  
Streets without light.  
And baby's not alone.  
  
Try to hold her to myself.  
Someone else is breaking all my dreams. She  
needs so many games to play.  
One more time I climb the stairs.  
Open up the door and she was gone.  
  
And baby here I go,  
like a lamb to slaughter.  
  
Don't stop haunting me in this old house (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I still love you when you're not around.  
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I'll still love you when it's cold outside.  
Me so sorry that I let you down (like a lamb to slaughter).  
But you keep haunting me in this old town.  
  
And the smile is no longer there.  
The face and the eyes and the hair.  
Nothing stands the test of time.  
You live forever, never mine.  
I cling to dreams that turn to sand.  
Our life is now a distant land.  
  
We commit emotional suicide.  
Every single room is electrified.  
Your memory shadowing me.  
The house where sorrow hides.  
  
Pull it down, blow it up.  
Help me send these walls of love away.  
  
And baby here I go,  
like a lamb to slaughter.  
  
Don't stop haunting me in this old house (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I still love you when you're not around.  
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I'll still love you when it's cold outside.  
Me so sorry that I let you down (like a lamb to slaughter)  
But you keep haunting me in this old town.

Don't stop haunting me in this old house (like a lamb to slaughter).

Bee Gees,Heart Like Mine,"Night grows cold.  
I've been lonely so much  
Out of reach.  
Save it only for me.  
  
Nothing in life is the same.  
And the sooner we stop to start.  
  
And there's a heart like mine  
Somewhere in this world.  
There's a heart like mine,  
Beating but left to burn.  
  
Maybe you can hide your face forever.  
And God knows it's true  
That when you search for someone  
  
There's a heart like mine,  
There's a heart like mine  
To be heard (to be heard).  
  
Souls on fire.  
Feel her voice in your ear.  
She goes on,  
Living only for me.  
  
Nothing you say could be wrong.  
'Cause you give me the lovers sign.  
  
And there's a heart like mine  
Somewhere in this world.  
There's a heart like mine,  
Beating but left to burn.  
  
Maybe we can share it all forever,  
But not 'til we do.  
I'm gonna search for someone.  
  
There's a heart like mine.  
There's a heart like mine  
To be heard (to be heard).

Bee Gees,Heartbreaker,"I got to say it and it's hard for me  
You got me crying like I thought I would never be  
Love is believing but you let me down  
How can I love you when you ain't around  
And I  
  
Get to the morning and you never call  
Love should be everything or not at all  
And it don't matter whatever you do  
I made a life out of loving you  
  
Only to find any dream that I follow is dying  
I'm crying in the rain  
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting  
Feeling no pain  
When will we meet again  
  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker  
Is it a lesson that I never knew?  
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under  
My love for you  
  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker  
When I was being what you want me to be?  
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by  
This world may end  
Not you and I  
  
My love is stronger than the universe  
My soul is crying for you  
And that cannot be reversed  
You made the rules and you could not see  
You made a life out of hurting me  
  
Out of my mind  
I am held by the power of you love  
Tell me when do we try  
Why should we say goodbye?  
  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker  
When I was being what you want me to be?  
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by  
  
Oh  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker  
Is it a lesson that I never knew?  
Suddenly everything I ever wanted  
My love for you, ooh  
  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker

Bee Gees,Heavy Breathing,"Well, this is my last connection , I been slowing up the line.  
Ain't no satisfaction in this troubled head of mine.

'cause sooner or later there's gonna be a showdown ,  
Gotta go man, gotta go.  
  
Hell, I'm so so tired , so so tired.  
And I don't know where I'm gonna start.  
It's only heavy breathing in the dark.  
  
Ain't nobody's sweetheart, ain't nobody's fool.  
And if the sun don't set on my house babe,  
I'd be the last man to blow my cool.  
I feel my body shake.  
Well, there's so much left to say.  
Spend my life anticipatin'.

Gotta take me from my suicide.  
Now you know it's love I crave.  
You know we got to live like this from the cradle to the grave.  
  
So so so so tired.  
So so so so tired.  
I'm so so so so tired.

Bee Gees,He's A Liar,"I was stood by the light as I looked through the window  
With the greatest intention not meaning to see  
I was there in the dark and I saw you together  
You were up in his arms , I was down on my knees  
Get the cards on the table  
No need to pretend  
You've got to be cruel to be kind  
He can sell you his love and you know yo will pay 'cause

He's a liar and I should know liar  
He's a liar and I should know - ahhh  
  
Well, they told me I fell but I just don't remember  
I was standing face down, they were there at my feet  
There was smoke in the air and sweet smell of leather  
I was through the window and down in the street  
Well, I'm cold and I'm hungry but I'm still alive  
And it's not how I want it to be  
There's a hand on my shoulder  
He said I'll survive ,but-  
  
He's a liar  
He's a liar, and I should know liar  
He's a liar,and I should know-ahhh

Was it not for the man that was blocking the drive  
Was it not for the red limousine

And somehow in this madness believe she was mine -but

And I should know liar

Take the time to be tender, that's the plan  
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces  
Only then can you hold her in your hand  
  
You got to live for every moment that she gives you  
Make the one in a million understand  
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces  
Only then can you hold her in your hand  
  
Now too many faces have come down between us  
And I was the fool to be  
And I can't deny you the wide open spaces  
As long as she stops loving me  
  
You got to stand a little closer when you hold her  
Make her feel like a woman , understand  
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces  
Only then can you hold her in your hand

I will be crying, yeah  
  
I was so lonely without you baby, don't know what I'm gonna do  
I'm going crazy without you baby, look at what I'm goin' through  
Baby, baby, baby  
My love, until the day we say auf wiedersehen

"
Bee Gees,Human Sacrifice,"I see she  
Knowing what I came here for  
Get a little of your womanifestation  
If I can pinpoint this feeling  
When you gonna let it grow  
We can draw the line on where we  
Let the fingers go  
  
Now I know me  
Never wanna lose control  
Making me the subject  
Of your warm initiation  
If I can pinpoint this feeling  
When you gonna let it show  
You make me nervous but it's now or never  
  
Oh Oh  
You can be my message from above  
And it's time to say you're sorry  
We can sanctify our love  
Oh no  
And you and I we're written in the wind  
You can't just go movin' out  
You can't leave me when I'm movin' in  
I want to be your human sacrifice  
I want to be your lover  
I want to be your human sacrifice  
I want to be your lover  
  
It's you or me  
Gotta be a kill or cure  
Maybe undergo a lover's operation  
Nothing cuts like a knife can  
You don't wanna hurt me more  
Look at all that damage  
We could do together  
  
Oh no  
You can wear me closer to the bone  
It don't work to make me worry  
But the demon seed is sown  
  
Oh no  
And you and I we're written in the sky  
You can't make me hold on  
Better you shoot my love between the eyes  
  
Your eyes on me on this table where I lie  
And what I see as fact is fiction  
You won't let me die  
And I'm bound to be abused  
I won't let you cut me loose  
This love is out to get you  
When the blood begins to flow

"
Bee Gees,I Am The World,"True love is one thing I've been dreaming of  
I give my soul to you and when I do  
You are to me, the very deepest part of me  
In the darkness, is you that always shows the way  
The very air I breathe  
When hope is gone  
You give me all the strength I need to carry on  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be  
  
When you hurt me, then I become the night time  
The shadows in my eyes don't make it good  
It shows this heart is not made of wood  
When you stay with me then I can feel the sunlight  
The love light fills my eyes  
And through the tears I feel my fears just melt away  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be

"
Bee Gees,I Can't See Anything,"I should thank you for the flowers  
Can't imagine how you came to think of those  
That same colour rose, for me  
My world is made up of memories  
You and I, the laughter and tears  
You never need to worry  
  
I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be so many others  
But I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
  
I remember all the good things  
When you held me for the first time  
Things were right  
On that rainy night, for us  
Love, then, now and forever  
No time real and right where we are  
As good as my eyes can be  
  
I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be some many others  
But I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
  
No one ever cried  
No one ever stood in the way  
Ev'rybody lies  
Ev'rybody buys what love is today  
You can be a fool  
In the beginning, baby you were there  
And when you're winning  
What do you do  
Don't ask me  
  
I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be so many others  
But I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be so many others but...

"
Bee Gees,I Close My Eyes,"Look at me I'm riding high  
Don't know what's wrong with me.  
Can't you see I'm not the guy  
That I pretend to be.  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes.  
  
The more I try the more I fail,  
I'd like to run away.  
But if I try you pass me by,  
I know that I can't stay.  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes.  
  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes  
I close my eyes. [Repeat: x3]

"
Bee Gees,I Could Not Love You More,"Now that we're alone.  
No more hide and seek.  
You are the highest dream to me.  
And as you softly sleep  
then I can tell you what it means.  
  
Locked in my arms like lovers lie,  
I will not let you slip away.  
Is this the summer of them all.  
Is this my night of nights  
that you came to stay.  
  
Here you are, owner of my heart,  
just the way that love should be.  
And there's something I must say to you,  
if you promise to believe  
that it's you I'm living for  
and I could not love you more.  
  
Seasons may come and seasons go  
but these are the truest words I know.  
Face to face, eye to eye.  
This is the summer of of our lives.  
One love that cannot die.  
  
Here you are, owner of my soul,  
never let you say goodbye.  
And there is something I must say to you,  
we leave the world outside  
and you have come to me at last, we start.  
  
Open up your heart,  
let my deepest love inside.  
I'm only doing what I have to do.  
If you promise to believe  
that I could not love you more.  
  
Here you are (you are), owner of my heart,  
just the way that love should be.  
And there's something I must say to you,  
we leave the world outside  
and you have come to me at last (at last), we start.  
  
Open up your heart,  
let my deepest love inside (ah).  
I'm only doing what I have to do.  
If you promise to believe  
that it's you I'm living for  
that it's you I'm living for  
and I could not love you more.

"
Bee Gees,I Don't Wanna Be The One,"It's too late to turn back now  
There ain't no space back there  
And how did I begin to lose my self control  
How did I begin to lose my self control  
  
There ain't a thing that you could give me  
With the love forever with me  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to be the one  
Remember it was only fun  
Two strangers touching in the sun, it had to end  
I don't want to be the guy to tell you things that make you cry  
You know as well as I know, you're my only friend  
  
There ain't a thing that you could give me  
With the love forever with me  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want to be the guy to tell you things that make you cry  
You know as well as I know, you're my only friend  
You know as well as I know you're my only friend  
You're my only friend  
My only friend  
My only friend

Bee Gees,I Have Decided To Join The Airforce,"Mother, I'm going to join the Air Force today.  
I don't care what the neighbors may say,  
But I'm going to join the Air Force today.  
  
Mother,I don't care what my father might think.  
Perhaps it's going to drive him to drink.  
But I don't care what my father might think.  
Don't ask me why, it's my mind and it's right.  
Don't ask me why, it's my mind ,  
It's better, it's better than being alone,  
Alone on the ground. Now I find  
  
Mother,I've got to join the Air Force you see,  
I've seen my friends and they all agree  
That's it's better than joining the army or going to sea

"
Bee Gees,I Held A Party,"I held a party and nobody came  
Strangely I was upset  
Poured out a drink and then Birkworth approached saying  
""Have no regrets. Maybe your gentle friends had some delay.  
Don't try to take on the world""  
  
Made up my bed and decided to sleep  
Dreaming I was awake  
Maybe I drank an excess of my drink  
Nice clan, cordial crowd  
Birkworth suggested we sleep through the night  
I never knew him so well

Bee Gees,I Laugh In Your Face,"The circus is coming to see you.  
The elephant smiles.  
Everybody can hear you say that's out of style.  
My brother is friendly for reasons, if I am the same.  
Just for four hundred seasons we all live in rain.  
  
So I laugh in your face.  
Your only one race.  
Yes I laugh in your face and I'm right.  
You lie just like the rest.  
But there's nobody best.  
So I laugh in your face and I'm right.

You'll slide down the drain.  
On the steps of St. Peter's you all look the same.

Bee Gees,I Lay Down And Die,"Only last night when your arms held me tight  
you told me you thought our love could last forever, forever  
I was the one that gave you all the love when I thought  
that our love could last forever, forever  
  
I lay down and die  
The whole world joins in  
And everyone cries as teardrops begin  
I lay down and die  
And when darkness falls  
can't seem right there at all  
I lay down and die  
The whole world joins in  
  
I lay down and die.  
The teardrops begin.  
I lay down and die.  
And die.  
And die.

And if you think I'm not the real thing

Bee Gees,I Started A Joke,"I started a joke which started the whole world crying  
But I didn't see that the joke was on me oh no  
I started to cry which started the whole world laughing  
Oh If I'd only seen that the joke was on me

Bee Gees,I Surrender,"From the highest tower,  
I will call you home.  
It's the same old story,  
love will find its own (oh).  
  
You come to me, conspiracy of the night.  
The heart that you want just happens to be mine.  
Thieves in the dark, you ought to be locked in chains  
but you wind up on my side, and what will be will be.  
  
That you wear a disguise, the epitome of deceit.  
The face of a friend invisible on the street.  
If you are battling to be mine, I'm victorious in defeat  
and I surrender (I surrender), I surrender.  
  
Anybody want me, anyone know my name.  
Do it in a lifetime,  
you be dust and the soul survives.  
Evens up the score (ah).  
  
From the highest tower,  
I will call you home.  
It's the same old story,  
love will find its own.  
  
And I surrender,  
take me for all time.  
Love that lasts forever,  
and I surrender.  
  
We are elite, prisoners of the night.  
We fight to the finish and savour the delights.  
It's your body that got me beat, and I'm crumbling at your feet,  
I surrender (I surrender), I surrender.

I will walk through fire to keep you safe and sound (oh no, oh no).  
In the final hour, turn my life around (oh no),  
and I surrender, take me for all time.  
  
You are the air that I breathe (oh)  
  
I will walk through fire, keep you safe and sound.  
In the final hour, turn my life around (oh).  
This is my life (life) story (story), I've been lost and found (oh no, oh no).  
In the final hour (in the final hour), turn my life around (oh no).  
  
And I surrender (surrender),

love as warm as wine  
I surrender ah ah...

Bee Gees,"I Was A Lover, A Leader Of Men","I was a lover, a leader of me  
All of the women I knew were my friends  
I was so happy, my feet on the ground  
I didn't know I was on the way down  
Cause you don't feel the same  
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game  
  
I had a billion or two in the bank  
I gave to charity, ain't got no thanks  
You gave me all that a woman could give  
Less you're affection, I don't want to live  
Cause you don't feel the same  
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game

"
Bee Gees,I Will,"Is this your voice I heard  
Speakin' my name  
I hang on every word.  
Each letter that I write  
Every day, every night  
But I just can't live and learn  
  
Talkin' to myself and believin'  
I could live without you  
Livin' on the lies and beleivin' that  
Love would stay  
Listen to me please and I'm beggin' on  
My knees before you  
But you don't show me the way  
No you don't show me the way  
  
He may change you're world and someday  
He may break your heart  
And you deserve no better  
If you love him I will step aside  
I offer this to you  
So leave me as I love you still  
And if he don't keep you warm  
You know I will  
You know I will  
  
So this is who you are  
And the rest of my life  
I dedicate to you  
And I know that love can't wait  
There's a moon and a sun  
And a dream that sees me through  
  
A little bit of change and  
A little bit of my desire  
I was shakin' all over and  
I didn't know what to say  
I'm the man in the middle and  
The middle man catches fire  
But I don't know how to go away  
No I don't know how to go away  
  
He became your hero somehow  
I became your clown  
And you deserve no better but my love  
Is here and all I found  
I offer this to you  
So leave me as I love you still  
And if he don't take your heart  
You know I will  
  
It ain't wise  
It ain't smart  
You say there's no doubt about it  
If you decide  
You got somebody else  
When I want you to myself  
I can't stop  
I can't look  
I can't say no more about it  
But my love will go on  
Just as long as the river flows  
  
He will be your king but someday  
He may let you down  
Follow to the letter that my love is  
Real and what I found  
I offer it to you  
So leave me as I love you still  
And if he don't keep you warm  
You know I will

Bee Gees,I Will Always Love You,"(Kenny Rogers On Vocals)  
  
I saw you tonight  
In the room where love had started once before.  
And we opened up the skies.  
With your loving eyes  
You take me back where you belong in my heart.  
  
One love frozen in time.  
Never be a bad love.  
Yours and mine.  
But I still remain.  
I will never change.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you.  
And then being close to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
  
Your hand in mine.  
You are inside of me.  
One more time.  
Don't you remember me.  
And the days that lie ahead  
May all go wrong.  
  
But tonight, my love,  
There's no question in my mind where we should be.  
It's clear that you're alone and I'm alone.  
And all the fools have gone.  
You open up so tears can fall from your eyes.  
  
True love can never die.  
We can make it one day, if we try.  
Be there, sunshine or rain.  
I will never change.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you and then  
Making love to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
  
Your hand in mine.  
I got a memory  
For all time.  
Don't you remember me.  
Now my dream will come true  
If you love me.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you and then  
Making love to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
Your hand in mine.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you and then  
Making love to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
Your hand in mine.

Bee Gees,Idea,"I been thinking sitting on a pole.  
I'm getting sick of doing what I'm told.  
Just me and the mirror and my brain.  
But that was when I got an idea.  
Came like a gun and shot in my ear.  
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?  
  
Fifteen years I lay down on the ground.  
I couldn't feel any noise or hear any sound.  
Fifteen million years I spent down the line.  
But that was when I got an idea.  
Came like a gun and shot in my ear.  
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?  
Get up and stand alone  
  
That was when I got an idea.

I'm surviving every lonely day  
When there's got to be  
No chance for me  
  
My life would end  
And it don't matter how I cry  
My tears of love  
Are a waste of time

Go crazy is what I will do

If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh  
If I can't have you

I gave it all so easily  
To you my love

Bee Gees,If I Only Had My Mind On Something Else,"I could be king of kings, wear a crown and all the things  
I'd want I'd never need.  
I'd be an ace in an aeroplane and every year I'd fly to Spain.  
If I could get the nerve to plant the seed.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, tell me how to say goodbye.  
I see her face in myself.  
Why, tell me why I made her cry  
If only had my mind on something else.  
  
Captain of the submarine beneath the icebergs never seen.  
A hero with a medal for everyday.  
I find me fame,reach the top.  
I keep on pushing never stop.  
If I could just forget her name.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If only had my mind on something else.

"
Bee Gees,I'll Kiss Your Memory,"Maybe it's been so long  
Our house looks kind of different  
But the empty rooms still mean the same to me  
And as I wander through the darkness  
I'll keep crying one last tear  
Now your lips are gone  
I'll kiss your memory  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll kiss your memory  
As though you were here  
I'll hold your memories till you reappear  
And as I wander through the darkness  
I'll keep crying one last tear  
Now your lips are gone  
I'll kiss your memory  
  
I'll kiss the thoughts of leaves that fell when summer was over  
And I'll cherish all the thoughts you gave to me  
And I will wander through the darkness  
I'll keep crying one last tear  
Now your lips are gone  
I'll kiss your memory  
  
[Chorus]

Bee Gees,Immortality,"So this is who I am,  
And this is all I know.  
And I must choose to live,  
For all that I can give,  
The spark that makes the power grow.  
  
And I will stand for my dream if I can,  
Symbol of my faith in who I am,  
But you are my only.  
  
And I must follow on the road that lies ahead.  
And I won't let my heart control my head.  
But you are my only.  
  
We don't say goodbye.  
We don't say goodbye.  
And I know what I've got to be  
  
Immortality.  
I make my journey through eternity.  
I keep the memory of you and me inside.  
  
Fulfill your destiny.  
Is there within the child?  
My storm will never end.  
My fate is on the wind.  
The king of hearts, the joker's wild.  
  
But we don't say goodbye.  
We don't say goodbye.  
I'll make them all remember me.  
  
'cause I have found a dream that must come true.  
Every ounce of me must see it through.  
You are my only.  
  
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play.  
Hand over my heart I'll find my way.  
I will make them give to me..(yeah)  
  
Immortality.(oh baby)  
There is a vision and a fire in me.(oh)  
I keep the memory of you and me, inside.  
  
We don't say goodbye.  
We don't say goodbye.  
With all my love for you.  
And what else we may do?..  
We don't say goodbye.

Bee Gees,In The Morning,"In the morning when the moon is at it's rest,  
You will see me at the time I love the best  
Watching rainbows play on sunlight,  
Pools of water iced from cold night,in the morning.  
'tis the morning of my life.  
  
In the daytime I will meet you as before.  
You will find me waiting by the ocean floor,  
Building castles in the shifting sands  
In a world that no one understands,  
In the morning.  
  
'tis the morning of my life,  
In the morning of my life the  
Minutes take so long to drift away  
Please be patient with your life  
It's only morning and you're still to live your day  
In the evening I will fly you to the moon  
To the top right hand corner of  
The ceiling in my room  
  
Where I'll stay until the sun shines  
Another day to swing on clothes lines  
May I be yawning  
  
It is the morning of my life  
It is the morning of my life  
In the morning  
In the morning  
In the morning

Bee Gees,Indian Gin And Whiskey Dry,"All day, all night you feel as if the earth could fly.  
Three more all for fine Indian Gin and whiskey dry,  
Fine Indian Gin and whiskey dry.  
  
Small town, closed down,  
There's nowhere else around to try.  
Disturbingly a voice would cry,  
""Go home, no loan,  
You'll have you gin and whiskey dry,  
You'll have your gin and whiskey dry"".  
  
Four ten, four men lining up for their handy brandy.  
All's gone, you're none, came the bartender's reply.  
But I've tried and I'm tied to Indian Gin and whiskey dry.  
  
To Indian Gin and whiskey dry [Repeat: x4]

Bee Gees,I.O.I.O.,"I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.  
  
You know I love getting up in the morning  
When the sun first strikes the trees  
All the morning birds are sing above  
Still bring back memories  
Of a girl who stood beside me  
When the rights I did were wrong  
But she went back down the river  
Just when I thought I could be strong  
When I thought I could be strong  
  
I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.  
I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.  
  
She never told me why she left me  
But the letter say goodbye  
Now my mornings are for wondering  
And my nights to reason why  
Why the stranger comes to steal the love  
Of a girl I had hold  
But she went back down the river  
Just when I thought I could be strong  
When I thought I could be strong  
So I sing  
  
I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.  
I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O.

"
Bee Gees,Irresistible Force,"In the name of love and life  
Turn your face to the lonely night  
But you're not alone when she calls you home  
And this your world is on the edge  
As good as lost but you know the way  
Through the faceless town  
And she pulls me down  
  
I know the place and the time (of our lives)  
So long ago  
And all through the years (never dies)  
All things must pass  
  
Irresistible force meets an immovable object and  
Human animal madness and blood starts to flow  
Invisible fingers and indescribable pleasure  
I get to find my personal god  
I get to find my personal god  
  
God of love, god of gold  
Ring of fire in the days of old  
It's what I'm living for and love's the only law  
So answer Mayday, S.O.S.  
Search me North, East, South, or West  
It's all I miss, just the one last kiss  
  
This is goodbye to the days (of our lives)  
My fair-weather friend  
I feel your sorrow and tears (they are mine)  
I share to the end  
  
Irresistible force meets an immovable object and  
Human animal magic  
How far can you go?  
The rolling of thunder and,  
You decide what you're after  
  
I get to find my personal god  
I get to find my personal god  
  
I surrender  
All or nothing  
You must spread your wings and fly  
  
I know the place and the time (of our lives)  
My fair-weather friend  
I feel your sorrow and tears (they are mine)  
We share to the end  
When an irresistible force meets an immovable object  
Human animal madness and blood starts to flow  
There's bound to be heartbreak  
You make it the hard way  
  
I surrender  
All or nothing  
You must spread your wings and fly

Drivin' my life away, dancin'  
I was a romeo  
I knew the art of romancin'  
I was just one of the guys  
And I thought I had it made  
I needed someone to show me how to love  
  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
The night was magic when we first met  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
You know you taught me to fly  
You take me clear to the sky  
And all the people around the world can stand aside  
For me and my baby, Juliet  
  
Fighting with destiny, fortune and fame but kept losing  
Playin' a joker's game, only myself I was foolin'  
I was an average guy in a world of empty dreams  
You've broken down all the walls with your love  
  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
This kind of lovin' you don't forget  
Juliet, oh Juliet  
You know you taught me to fly  
You take me clear to the sky  
And all the people around the world can stand aside  
  
Close your eyes, Juliet, don't let go  
  
On and on, our love is like the sun  
It keeps going strong throughout eternity  
I wanna love you in my life, sweet Juliet  
Livin' without you in my life, oh my girl Juliet

You know you taught me to fly  
You take me clear to the sky

Bee Gees,Jumbo,"Jumbo said to say goodnight  
See you in the morning  
Please don't lose your appetite

Sail a sailboat trough a fountain

Play no games , he'd say to me  
We know who is wrong  
So please don't make no hesitation  
There will be no recriation

He's a friend of yours  
Listen you can chew it  
If it's loud enough you can hear it  
  
'Cause it's narrow as a sparrow  
And it shoots a bow and arrow  
Thro'a top that's made with  
Powder with a gun it's even louder  
  
And it's shattering to hear  
Yuo mustn't listen with your ear  
But it gets to you  
Yes ! yes ! yes ! yes ! yes ! yes !

Bee Gees,Just In Case,"Babe  
It seems every night and day, I get to lose  
And I always held the faith inside  
That love would find a way  
And I always reached for more  
Than the others ever saw  
  
I was always the first to follow  
My foolish prayer  
And the feelings that I have are more than  
Any soul can bare  
  
Only when I wake  
Then I can be sure of who I am  
I'm half the man I should be  
When you're gone and you're telling me  
  
This is love but just in case  
I keep my heart in a secret place  
Safe under lock and key  
'Til I know it's only me  
One of us got to be the one that's true  
One for the other and the love comes through  
Right here or out in space  
Give my heart to you,babe  
But just in case, just in case.  
  
Tell the world that I come to claim  
Your tomorrows  
Let the universal word go out  
A million miles away  
And history has shown  
that when the seed is sown  
We are livig in a time when the tears fall  
Where they might  
But we hear each other much more than those who  
See  
We are not alone  
Love is there for everyone who needs  
And for anyone who cries  
And I will alaways have you here with me  
  
And you're telling me  
This is love, but just in case  
Keep my heart in a secret place  
Safe under lock and key  
'Til I know it's only me  
One of us got to be the one that's true  
One for the other and the love comes through  
Yours,mine and face to face  
Give my heart to you,babe  
But just in case

I got you leaving me and missing you  
And me believing that you've never done right  
When you've never done wrong.

Imitations,  
Existing out of time.

You know, you know I prayed for sunshine,  
A woman with my name.

You gave away the game.

Don't look at me as if you don't remember me at all  
There was laughter, there was pain  
But I won't make the same mistakes I made  
You are too beautiful to me  
I hide my tears inside the rain  
  
Am I the soul you cast your spell upon  
I had control and now it's gone  
Or are you someone who controls my heart and mind  
And I will never say a word  
And I will never say goodbye

And it reads ""do not return""  
And there is so much trouble I could cause  
Someone as beautiful as you  
You can feel my candle burn  
  
And I still recall some starry night  
We had it all, we held on tight  
I promised I would come to you and catch you if you fall  
And they will never know about us  
For just one moment you were mine

Bee Gees,Lost In Your Love,"I was lost in your love  
I was held by your heart  
And no secrets stood between us anymore  
I'm like a child learning pain  
I was held by your chains  
And my darling , I was lost in your love  
  
There's been a diff'rence of opinion to the way I've been treating you  
But you know that I've tried to apologize,  
for all the bad times I've put you through  
On the chance that I could make you mine  
There's not a thing I would not do  
And wrong or right I'll be with you and lost in your love  
  
I was lost in your love  
I was held by your heart  
And no secrets stood between us anymore  
I'm like a child learning pain  
I was held by your chains  
And my darling , I was lost in your love  
  
Now I will follow you where the wild bird flies  
Through endless skies I will go  
So I can be so near you girl and all of this you gotta know  
That when I get you here inside my arms  
I never ever ever will let you go  
And wrong or right I'll be with you and lost in your love

I remember times my love  
When we really had it all  
You were always there to make me smile  
To help me when I fall  
  
Ooh I can't believe you're leaving me  
When there's so much more to say  
I can't let you go  
Ooh Every time I look at you,  
I still can feel the glow  
Let it be, let it grow  
  
Ooh Love me, please  
Just a little bit longer  
Together, we can make it  
Our love is much too young to break it  
  
Love me please,  
Just a little bit harder  
Together we can make it  
Our love is much too young to break it.  
  
Oh all I ever wanted was  
To have you to myself  
Then I see you standing there  
In the arms of someone else  
  
Ooh You know a girl can stand so much  
And it's more than I can fake  
  
I can't let you go  
Ooh every time I look at you  
I still can feel the glow  
Let it be, let it grow

And when you walk away  
From me baby you're gonna be sorry  
I'm begging you please  
  
Love me, please love me, love me

Bee Gees,Love Never Dies,"You say you saw the dark side  
Baby I know  
It Gets you through the night  
And love is like a red rose baby and so  
It's coming around again  
If we can take the same direction we'll find  
The road that never ends  
But love never dies  
It goes on forever love never dies  
Love never dies it goes on forever  
This is the love you've been talking about  
You led her in till she couldn't get out  
You made the little girl cry  
No sad stories to deny  
I go through holy war for you baby you know  
You say you ain't got a prayer  
I'll answer if you call for me  
Baby I'm yours  
To God above I swear  
I only wanna live in the shadow you make  
The soul never lies  
But love never dies it goes on forever  
Love never dies, love never dies  
It goes on forever  
You better run to the heart of the flame  
She don't change like the sun in the rain  
She don't understand why  
You made the little girl cry  
Love never dies, it goes on forever love never dies  
Love never dies it goes on forever  
this is the love you've been talking about  
You led her in till she couldn't get out  
You made the little girl cry  
No sad stories to deny  
You better run to the heart of the flame

Bee Gees,Love So Right,"She came on like the night and she held on tight  
And the world was right when she made love to me  
We were free  
She moved in like a friend, started loving me  
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms  
But the morning when I woke up  
I was here and she was gone  
Now I'm hanging on  
Maybe you can tell me how a love so right can turn out to be so wrong  
  
Where did she go when I need her close to me  
And the perfect story ended at the start  
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart  
Now I'm hanging on, on the chance that you'll come back to me  
  
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling  
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling  
I could take it in my stride  
Start living for the moment  
Maybe half the things we sought were never there  
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size  
It isn't really fair

Bee Gees,Love You Inside And Out,"Love You Inside Out  
  
Baby, I can't figure it out  
Your kisses taste like honey  
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise  
Oh, oh what you're trying to do?  
  
Livin' on your cheatin'  
And the pain grows inside me  
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain  
Love you forever but you're  
Driving me insane  
And I'm hanging on  
Oh, oh, I'll win, I'll never give in  
  
Our love has got the power  
Too many lovers in one lifetime  
Ain't good for you  
You treat me like a vision in the night  
Someone there to stand behind you  
When your world ain't working right  
  
I ain't no vision, I am the man  
Who loves you inside out  
Backwards and forwards with  
My heart hanging out  
I love no other way  
  
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?  
Wrap myself up and take me home again  
Too many heartaches in one  
Lifetime ain't good for me  
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm  
  
Let this moment be forever  
We won't ever feel the storm  
I ain't no vision, I am the man  
Who loves you inside out  
Backwards and forwards with  
My heart hanging out  
  
I love no other way  
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?  
Don't try to tell me it's all over  
I can't hear a word I can't hear a line  
No man could love you more  
And that's what I'm cryin' for  
You can't change the way I feel inside  
  
You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow  
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow  
No man on earth can stand  
Between my love and I  
And no matter how you hurt me  
I will love you till I die  
  
I ain't no vision, I am the man  
Who loves you inside out  
Backwards and forwards with  
My heart hanging out  
I love no other way  
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

You took advantage and the damage done.  
It all comes back to me, baby.  
It all comes back to me.  
  
I played the fool and I went off the track.  
And when I think of all it cost,  
When the dice was cast,  
You know I had to be crazy,  
You know I had to be.  
  
I've been telling lies,  
And you forgive me but my heart still cries.  
And you can understand  
  
I'm just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan.  
No one to show me the signs.  
I'm just a creature of habit  
In a complicated world.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide, to hide, to hide, to hide....  
  
I know I let you down in so many ways.  
I know that sorry doesn't tell you  
What you need me to say.  
But, I would die for you, baby.  
Yes, I would die for you.  
  
I've been in disguise.  
And you forgive me and our love will rise.  
And you can understand  
  
I'm just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan.  
No one to show me the light.  
Ah,yes, I'm weary from battle  
But I've just begun to fight.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide.

If you feed me baby  
I'm a man on fire  
An eternal flame  
It'll burn on forever  
If you feed me baby, oh  
  
Gotta be a place to go in the midnight hour  
Heart of a woman and just a little bit of pulling power  
The feeling's got me  
I don't know what it means  
I know it must be wrong  
But when you love somebody you dream, and I dream  
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come  
And you're there, and you're gone  
And I'm alive for you  
And my love keeps hanging on  
  
There is no life  
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love  
There is no unifying, if I don't hear you crying  
I'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world  
Together we are strong in love  
And when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can be  
And me, I'm a man on fire  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ready when the lightning strikes and he deed is done  
I'm not a beginner  
But I'm a sinner when the heat is on  
Nothing gonna stop me, got me all that you need  
Woman, when you need somebody  
A woman with a face and a body, you dream, and I dream  
  
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come  
And you're there and you're gone  
And I'm alive for you  
And my love keeps hanging on  
  
There is no life  
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love  
There is no unifying, if I don't hear you crying  
I'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world  
Together we are strong enough  
And when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can me  
And me, I'm a man on fire

Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco,  
Gotta do the things I wanna do.  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts

Speak about the people I have seen,  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts  
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.  
  
I will remember Massachusetts

There isn't time to count the shoulders I have cried on  
That's just circumstances , I must take my chances  
But, baby you don't know what I'm saying  
But I guess that's not true  
And you know that's true  
But there's a method to my madness

Bee Gees,Miracles Happen,"Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
If we just try  
We can put it back together, you and I.  
And all the bad is blown away.  
I never said goodbye.

That makes you see.  
And it's the saviour of my soul.  
And what I say that must be heard  
With love in every word.  
  
Close your eyes, don't let go,  
Don't get lost in the falling snow.

With someone you're not sure of.  
  
Broken wings don't arrive.  
It's a storm but you still survive.  
  
It's gonna take a miracle.

Nobody knows how much  
I pray for you at night.  
And miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
And yesterday  
There was nothing in my life worth living for.  
You were there and I was born,  
The very strength to carry on  
A miracle has come.  
  
Hold on tight, call my name,  
Don't get caught in the midnight rain.  
Part of me believes in you,  
You're someone I'm not sure of.  
  
Don't look down, I'll be there,  
Like the wind in the cold night air.  
I can see a miracle.  
  
And through it all we rise and fall,  
Tear it apart and stay forever.  
And I know where heaven is  
And somewhere in between  
Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
Red, blue, black and white.  
True light shine on anyone.  
Two hearts make it right.  
And all that love can change.  
  
Close my eyes, don't let go.  
I'll be lost in the falling snow.  
Always out of place alone,  
With someone I'm not sure of.

Bee Gees,More Than A Woman,"Girl, I've known you very well  
I've seen you growing every day  
I never really looked before  
But now you take my breath away  
  
Suddenly you're in my life  
A part of everything I do  
You got me workin' day and night  
Just tryin' to keep a hold on you  
  
Here in your arms I found my paradise  
My only chance for happiness  
And if I lose you now, I think I would die  
Say you'll always be my baby  
We can make it shine  
We can take forever just a minute at a time  
  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
  
There are stories old and true  
Of people so in love like you and me  
And I can see myself  
Let history repeat itself  
  
Reflecting how I feel for you  
And thinking about those people then  
I know that in a thousand years  
I'd fall in love with you again  
  
This is the only way that we should fly  
This is the only way to go  
And if I lose your love, I know I would die  
Oh say you'll always be my baby  
We can make it shine  
We can take forever just a minute at a time

More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me

More than a woman to me

More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me

"
Bob Dylan,4Th Time Around,"When she said, ""Don't waste your words, they're just lies,""  
I cried she was deaf.  
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,  
Then said, ""What else you got left?""  
It was then that I got up to leave  
But she said, ""Don't forget,  
Everybody must give something back  
For something they get.""  
  
I stood there and hummed,  
I tapped on her drum  
And asked her how come.  
And she buttoned her boot,  
And straightened her suit,  
Then she said, ""Don't get cute.""  
So I forced my hands in my pockets  
And felt with my thumbs,  
And gallantly handed her  
My very last piece of gum.  
  
She threw me outside,  
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.  
And after finding I'd forgotten my shirt,  
I went back and knocked.  
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,  
And I tried to make sense  
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair  
That leaned up against--  
  
Her Jamaican rum  
And when she did come, I asked her for some.  
She said, ""No, dear.""  
I said, ""Your words aren't clear,  
You'd better spit out your gum.""  
She screamed till her face got so red,  
Then she fell on the floor,  
And I covered her up and then  
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.  
  
And when I was through  
I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.  
And you, you took me in,  
You loved me then, you never wasted time.  
And I, I never took much,  
I never asked for your crutch  
And I don't ask for mine.

Bob Dylan,A Satisfied Mind,"How many times have you heard someone say  
If I had his money I'd do things my way  
Hmm, but little they know  
Hmm, it's so hard to find  
One man in ten with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, once I was wading in fortune and fame  
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game  
But suddenly it happened  
Hmm, I lost every dime  
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out  
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there ain't no doubt  
But one things for certain  
When it comes my time  
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

Bob Dylan,All Over You,"By Bob Dylan  
  
Well, if I had to do it all over again,  
Babe, I'd do it all over you.  
And if I had to wait for ten thousand years,  
Babe, I'd even do that too.  
Well, a dog's got his bone in the alley,  
A cat, she's got nine lives,  
A millionaire's got a million dollars,  
King Saud's got four hundred wives.  
Well, ev'rybody's got somethin'  
That they're lookin' forward to.  
I'm lookin' forward to when I can do it all again  
And babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today,  
Babe, I'd run circles all around.  
I'd jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin,  
I'd even dance a jig on the ground.  
Well, everybody gets their hour,  
Everybody gets their time,  
Little David when he picked up his pebbles,  
Even Sampson after he went blind.  
Well, everybody gets the chance  
To do what they want to do.  
When my time arrives you better run for your life  
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
Well, I don't need no money, I just need a day that's sunny,  
Baby, and my days are gonna come.  
And I grab me a pint, you know that I'm a giant  
When you hear me yellin', ""Fee-fi-fo-fum.""  
Well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle,  
You made me to a walkin' wreck,  
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone,  
Then you knocked off my head from my neck.  
Well, if I'm ever standin' steady  
A-doin' what I want to do,  
Well, I tell you little lover that you better run for cover  
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
I'm just restin' at your gate so that I won't be late  
And, momma, I'm a-just sittin' on the shelf.  
Look out your window fair and you'll see me squattin' there  
Just a-fumblin' and a-mumblin' to myself.  
Well, after my cigarette's been smoked up,  
After all my liquor's been drunk,  
After my dreams are dreamed out,  
After all my thoughts have been thunk,  
Well, after I do some of these things,  
I'm gonna do what I have to do.  
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide  
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.

"
Bob Dylan,Ballad Of Donald White,"My name is Donald White, you see,  
I stand before you all.  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangman's knot must fall.  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear,  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear.  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young,  
I landed in the old Northwest,  
Seattle, Washington  
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,  
I never made a friend,  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met.  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start,  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts.  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young,  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,  
That's how my life begun.  
  
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,  
I found they were my kind,  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind.  
But the jails they were too crowded,  
Institutions overflowed,  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Life's hurried tangled road.  
  
And there's danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high,  
And there's danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly,  
And there's danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free,  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society.  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home.  
But they said they were too crowded,  
For me they had no room.  
I got down on my knees and begged,  
""Oh, please put me away,""  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say.  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of '59,  
It was on that night I killed a man,  
I did not try to hide,  
The jury found me guilty  
And I won't disagree,  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasn't put away.  
  
And I'm glad I've had no parents  
To care for me or cry,  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die.  
And I'm also glad I've had no friends  
To see me in disgrace,  
For they'll never see that hangman's hood  
Wrap around my face.  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam,  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of which've been my home,  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me,  
I guess you'll feel much better when  
I'm on that hanging tree.  
  
But there's just one question  
Before they kill me dead,  
I'm wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me,  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society?

Your baby's eyes look crazy  
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve

There's no water in your well  
Your spent your last lone dollar  
On seven shotgun shels.  
  
Way out in the wilderness  
A cold coyote calls  
Way out in the wilderness  
A cold coyote calls  
Your eyes fix on the shortgun  
That's hangin' on the wall.  
  
Your brain is a-bleedin'  
And your legs can't seem to stand  
Your brain is a-bleedin'  
And your legs can't seem to stand  
Your eyes fix on the shortgun  
That you're holdin' in your hand.  
  
There's seven breezes a-blowin'  
All around the cabin door  
There's seven breezes a-blowin'  
All around the cabin door  
Seven shots ring out  
Like the ocean's pounding roar.  
  
There's seven people dead  
On a south Dakota farm  
There's seven people dead  
On a south Dakota farm  
Somewhere in the distance  
There's seven new people born.

"
Bob Dylan,Belle Isle,"One evening for pleasure I rambled to view  
The fair fields all alone  
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron  
Where beauty and pleasure were known.  
  
I spied a fair maid at her labour  
Which caused me to stay for a while  
And I thought of a goddess to beauty  
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle.  
  
I humbled myself to her beauty  
""Fair maiden, where do you belong ?  
Are you from heaven descended  
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne ?"".  
  
""Young man, I will tell you a secret  
It's true I'm a maid that is poor  
And to part from my vows and my promise  
Is more than my heart can endure.  
  
Therefore I remain at my service  
And go through all my hardship and toil  
And wait for the lad that has left me  
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle"".  
  
""Young maiden I wish not to banter  
It's true I come here in disguise  
I came here to fulfill our last promise  
And hope to give you a surprise.  
  
I've known you're a maid I love dearly  
And you've been in my heart all the while  
For me there is no other damsel  
Than my bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle"".

Bob Dylan,Beyond Here Lies Nothin',"Oh well, I love you pretty baby  
You're the only love I've ever known  
Just as long as you stay with me  
The whole world is my throne  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing we can call our own  
  
Well, I'm moving after midnight  
Down boulevards of broken cars  
Don't know what I do without it  
Without this love that we call ours  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing but the moon and stars  
  
Down every street there's a window  
And every window made of glass  
We'll keep on loving pretty baby  
For as long as love will last  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
But the mountains of the past  
  
Well my ship is in the harbor  
And the sails are spread  
Listen to me, pretty baby  
Lay your hand upon my head  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing done and nothing said

"
Bob Dylan,Beyond The Horizon,"Beyond the horizon, behind the sun  
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun  
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above  
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love  
  
My wretched heart's pounding  
I felt an angel's kiss  
My memories are drowning  
In mortal bliss  
  
Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall  
Love waits forever for one and for all  
  
Beyond the horizon across the divide  
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side  
Down in the valley the water runs cold  
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul  
  
I'm touched with desire  
What don't I do?  
I'll throw the logs on the fire  
I'll build my world around you  
  
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game  
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same  
  
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow  
The theme of a melody from many moons ago  
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime  
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time  
  
It's dark and it's dreary  
I ponder in vain  
I'm weakened, I'm weary  
My repentance is plain  
  
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea  
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me  
  
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies  
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes  
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone  
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone  
  
It's late in the season  
Never knew, never cared  
Whatever the reason  
Someone's life has been spared  
  
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue  
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you

Wasted and worn out.  
I woke in the mornin', wand'rin',  
Wasted and worn out.  
Wishin' my long-lost lover  
Will walk to me, talk to me,  
Tell me what it's all about.  
  
I was standin' at the side road  
Listenin' to the billboard knock.  
Standin' at the side road  
Listenin' to the billboard knock.  
Well, my wrist was empty  
But my nerves were kickin',  
Tickin' like a clock.  
  
If I got anything you need, babe,  
Let me tell you in front.  
If I got anything you need, babe,  
Let me tell you in front.  
You can come to me sometime,

Any time you want.

I'm too high to fall.  
Sometimes I'm thinkin'  
I'm too high to fall.  
Other times I'm thinkin' I'm  
So low I don't know  
If I can come up at all.  
  
Black crows in the meadow  
Across a broad highway.  
Black crows in the meadow  
Across a broad highway.  
Though it's funny, honey,  
I just don't feel much like a  
Scarecrow today.

Bob Dylan,Blind Willie Mctell,"Seen the arrow on the doorpost  
Saying, ""This land is condemned  
All the way from New Orleans  
To Jerusalem. ""  
I traveled through East Texas  
Where many martyrs fell  
And I know no one can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing  
As they were taking down the tents  
The stars above the barren trees  
Were his only audience  
Them charcoal gypsy maidens  
Can strut their feathers well  
But nobody can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
See them big plantations burning  
Hear the cracking of the whips  
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming  
(And) see the ghosts of slavery ships  
I can hear them tribes a-moaning  
(I can) hear the undertaker's bell  
(Yeah), nobody can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
There's a woman by the river  
With some fine young handsome man  
He's dressed up like a squire  
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand  
There's a chain gang on the highway  
I can hear them rebels yell  
And I know no one can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
Well, God is in heaven  
And we all want what's his  
But power and greed and corruptible seed  
Seem to be all that there is  
I'm gazing out the window  
Of the St. James Hotel  
And I know no one can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell

Bob Dylan,Blowin' In The Wind,"How many roads must a man walk down  
Before you can call him a man?  
How many seas must a white dove sail  
Before she sleeps in the sand?  
Yes, how many times must the cannon balls fly  
Before they're forever banned?  
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  
  
Yes, how many years can a mountain exist  
Before it's washed to the sea?  
Yes, how many years can some people exist  
Before they're allowed to be free?  
Yes, how many times can a man turn his head  
Pretending he just doesn't see?  
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  
  
Yes, how many times must a man look up  
Before he can really see the sky?  
Yes, how many ears must one man have  
Before he can hear people cry?  
Yes, how many deaths will it take till he knows  
That too many people have died?

"
Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's Dream,"While riding on a train goin' west,  
I fell asleep for to take my rest.  
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,  
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.  
  
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room  
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,  
Where we together weathered many a storm,  
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.  
  
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,  
Our words were told, our songs were sung,  
Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied  
Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.  
  
With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,  
We never thought we could ever get old.  
We thought we could sit forever in fun  
But our chances really was a million to one.  
  
As easy it was to tell black from white,  
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.  
And our choices were few and the thought never hit  
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.  
  
How many a year has passed and gone,  
And many a gamble has been lost and won,  
And many a road taken by many a friend,  
And each one I've never seen again.  
  
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,  
That we could sit simply in that room again.  
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,  
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.

"
Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's New Orleans Rag,"By Bob Dylan  
  
I was sittin' on a stump  
Down in New Orleans,  
I was feelin' kinda low down,  
Dirty and mean.  
Along came a fella  
And he didn't even ask.  
He says, ""I know of a woman  
That can fix you up fast. ""  
I didn't think twice,  
I said like I should,  
""Let's go find this lady  
That can do me some good. ""  
We walked across the river  
On a sailin' spree  
And we came to a door  
Called one-oh-three.  
  
I was just about ready  
To give it a little knock  
When out comes a fella  
Who couldn't even walk.  
He's linkin' and a-slinkin',  
Couldn't stand on his feet,  
And he moaned and he groaned  
And he shuffled down the street.  
Well, out of the door  
There comes another man.  
He wiggled and he wobbled,  
He couldn't hardly stand.  
He had this frightened  
Look in his eyes,  
Like he just fought a bear,  
He was ready to die.  
  
Well, I peeked through the key crack,  
Comin' down the hall  
Was a long-legged man  
Who couldn't hardly crawl.  
He muttered and he uttered  
In broken French,  
And he looked like he'd been through  
A monkey wrench.  
  
Well, by this time  
I was a-scared to knock,  
I was a-scared to move,  
I's in a state of shock.  
I hummed a little tune  
And I shuffled my feet  
And I started walkin' backwards  
Down that broad street.  
Well, I got to the corner,  
I tried my best to smile.  
I turned around the corner  
And I ran a bloody mile.  
Man, I wasn't runnin'  
'Cause I was sick,  
I was just a-runnin'  
To get out of there quick.  
  
Well, I tripped right along  
And I'm a-wheezin' in my chest.  
I musta run a mile  
In a minute or less.  
I walked on a log  
And I tripped on a stump,  
I caught a fast freight  
With a one-arm jump.  
So, if you're travelin' down  
Louisiana way,  
And you feel kinda lonesome  
And you need a place to stay,  
Man, you're better off  
In your misery  
Than to tackle that lady  
At one-oh-three.

Bob Dylan,Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?,"He sits in your room, his tomb with a fist full of tacks  
Preoccupied with his vengeance  
Cursin' the dead that can't answer him back  
You know he has no intentions  
Of looking your way, unless it's to say  
That he needs you to test his inventions.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
  
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels  
Trying to peel the moon and expose it  
With his business-like anger and bloodhounds that kneel  
If he needs a third eye he just grows it  
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk  
Or pick it up after he throws it.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you

He looks so righteous while your face is so changed  
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in  
While his genocide fools and friends rearrange  
Their religion of the little ten women  
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised  
Come on out the dark is beginning.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.

Bob Dylan,Can't Help Falling In Love,"Wise men say only fools rush in  
But I can't help falling in love with you.  
Shall I stay, will it be a sin  
If I can't help falling in love with you?  
  
Like a river flows surely to the sea  
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.  
Take my hand, take my whole life too  
For I can't help falling in love with you.  
  
Like a river flows surely to the sea  
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.

"
Bob Dylan,Catfish,"Lazy stadium night  
Catfish on the mound.  
""Strike three,"" the umpire said,  
Batter have to go back and sit down.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm  
But the old man wouldn't pay  
So he packed his glove and took his arm  
An' one day he just ran away.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Come up where the Yankees are,  
Dress up in a pinstripe suit,  
Smoke a custom-made cigar,  
Wear an alligator boot.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Carolina born and bred,  
Love to hunt the little quail.  
Got a hundred-acre spread,  
Got some huntin' dogs for sale.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Reggie Jackson at the plate  
Seein' nothin' but the curve,  
Swing too early or too late  
Got to eat what Catfish serve.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Even Billy Martin grins  
When the Fish is in the game.  
Every season twenty wins  
Gonna make the Hall of Fame.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.

"
Bob Dylan,Chimes Of Freedom,"Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll  
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing  
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing  
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight  
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight  
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain  
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning  
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake  
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened  
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail  
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder  
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze  
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder  
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind  
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind  
An' the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales  
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position  
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts  
All down in taken-for-granted situations  
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute  
Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute  
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed  
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones  
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look  
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended  
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed  
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse  
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Bob Dylan,Christmas Island,"How'd ya like to spend Christmas  
On Christmas Island?  
How'd ya like to spend the holiday  
Away across the sea?  
How'd ya like to spend Christmas  
On Christmas Island?  
How'd ya like to hang a stocking  
On a great big coconut tree?  
  
How'd ya like to stay up late  
Like the islanders do?  
Wait for Santa to sail  
In with your presents in a canoe  
If you ever spend Christmas  
On Christmas Island  
You will never stray for everyday  
Your Christmas dreams come true  
  
How'd ya like to stay up late

"
Bob Dylan,Clean-Cut Kid,"Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust  
Adjust to what, a dream that bust?  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is  
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made him a killer  
That's what they did.  
  
He was on the basketball team, he was in the marching band  
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
They said, ""Listen boy, you're just a pup""  
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.  
  
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills  
A jeep to drive, blood to spill.  
  
They said, ""Congratulation, you got what it takes""  
They sent him back into the race without any brakes.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
He bought the American Dream but put it in doubt  
Only game he could play was Russian Roulette.  
  
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread  
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.  
  
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole  
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove in a pool.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar  
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.  
  
He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day  
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.  
  
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans  
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
Everybody's asking why he didn't adjust  
All he wanted was somebody to trust.  
  
They took his head and turned it inside out  
He never did know what it was all about.  
  
He had a steady job, he joined the choir  
He never did plan to walk the high wire.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him That's what they did.

"
Bob Dylan,Clothes Line,"After a while we took in the clothes,  
Nobody said very much.  
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants  
Which nobody really wanted to touch.  
Mama come in and picked up a book  
An' Papa asked her what it was.  
Someone else asked, ""What do you care?""  
Papa said, ""Well, just because.""  
Then they started to take back their clothes,  
Hang 'em on the line.  
It was January the thirtieth  
And everybody was feelin' fine.  
  
The next day everybody got up  
Seein' if the clothes were dry.  
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed,  
Mama, of course, she said, ""Hi!""  
""Have you heard the news?"" he said, with a grin,  
""The Vice-President's gone mad!""  
""Where?"" ""Downtown."" ""When?"" ""Last night.""  
""Hmm, say, that's too bad!""  
""Well, there's nothin' we can do about it,"" said the neighbor,  
""It's just somethin' we're gonna have to forget.""  
""Yes, I guess so,"" said Ma,  
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet.  
  
I reached up, touched my shirt,  
And the neighbor said, ""Are those clothes yours?""  
I said, ""Some of 'em, not all of 'em.""  
He said, ""Ya always help out around here with the chores?""  
I said, ""Sometime, not all the time.""  
Then my neighbor, he blew his nose  
Just as papa yelled outside,  
""Mama wants you t' come back in the house and bring them clothes.""  
Well, I just do what I'm told,  
So, I did it, of course.  
I went back in the house and Mama met me  
And then I shut all the doors.

"
Bob Dylan,Copper Kettle,"Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil  
Fill it with new made corn mash and never more you'll toil  
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.  
  
Build you a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak  
Don't use no green or rotten wood, they'll get you by the smoke  
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.  
  
My daddy he made whiskey, my granddaddy he did too  
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792  
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.

"
Bob Dylan,Country Pie,"Just like old Saxophone Joe  
When he's hot ,the hogshead up on his toe  
Oh me, oh my  
Love that country pie.  
  
Listen to the fiddler play  
When he's playin' 'til the break of day  
Oh me, oh my  
Love that country pie.  
  
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime  
What do I care?  
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum  
Call me for dinner,  
Honey, I'll be there.  
  
Saddle me up on my big white goose  
Tie me on 'er turn her loose  
Oh me, oh my  
Love that country pie.  
  
I don't need much and that ain't no lie  
Ain't runnin' any race  
Give to me my country pie  
I won't throw it up in anybody's face.  
  
Shake me up that old peach tree  
Little Jack Horner's got nothin' on me  
Oh me, oh my  
Love that country pie.

"
Bob Dylan,Cry A While,"Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith  
A nasty, dirty, double-crossin', back-stabbin' phony I didn't want to have to
be dealin' with  
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn to cry awhile  
  
I don't carry dead weight - I'm no flash in the pan  
All right, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?  
I'm lettin' the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Feel like a fighting rooster - feel better than I ever felt  
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to
melt  
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls  
It must have been Don Pasquale makin' a two a.m. booty call  
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn to cry awhile  
  
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control  
Some people they ain't human, they got no heart or soul  
Well, I'm crying to The Lord - I'm tryin' to be meek and mild  
Yes, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Well, there's preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs  
I'm longin' for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs  
I'm gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey - I'll die before I turn senile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way  
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day  
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial  
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry awhile

"
Bob Dylan,Dark Eyes,"Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside  
They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide  
I live in another world where life and death are memorized  
Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer  
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere  
But I hear another rum beating for the dead that rise  
Whom nature's beast fear as they come and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes  
They tell me revenge is sweet, I'm sure it is  
But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized  
All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel  
Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling god of speed and steel  
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that
flies  
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.

"
Bob Dylan,Dear Landlord,"Dear landlord,  
Please don't put a price on my soul.  
My burden is heavy,  
My dreams are beyond control.  
When that steamboat whistle blows,  
I'm gonna give you all I got to give,  
And I do hope you receive it well,  
Dependin' on the way you feel that you live.  
  
Dear landlord,  
Please heed these words that I speak.  
I know you've suffered much,  
But in this you are not so unique.  
All of us, at times, we might work too hard  
To have it too fast and too much,  
And anyone can fill his life up  
With things he can see but he just cannot touch.  
  
Dear landlord,  
Please don't dismiss my case.  
I'm not about to argue,  
I'm not about to move to no other place.  
Now, each of us has his own special gift  
And you know this was meant to be true,  
And if you don't underestimate me,  
I won't underestimate you.

Gal, what's on your mind?  
You got your eyes closed,  
Heaven knows that you ain't blind.  
  
Well, I can see you smiling,  
But oh your mouth is inside out.  
I can see you smiling,  
But you're smiling inside out.  
Well, I know you're laughin'  
But what are you laughin' about.  
  
Well, if you're tryin' to throw me,  
Babe, I've already been tossed.  
If you're tryin' to throw me,  
Babe, I've already been tossed.  
Babe, you're tryin' to lose me.  
Babe, I'm already lost.  
  
Well, what are you doing,  
Are you flying or have you flipped?  
Oh, what are you doing,  
Are you flying or have you flipped?  
Well, you call my name  
And then say your tongue just slipped.  
  
Denise, Denise,  
You're concealed here on the shelf.  
Denise, Denise,  
You're concealed here on the shelf.  
I'm looking deep in your eyes, babe,  
And all I can see is myself.

"
Bob Dylan,Dirt Road Blues,"Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone will let me ride  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone will let me ride  
If I can't find my baby I'm gonna run away and hide  
Well, I been pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back  
pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back  
Well, I been praying for salvation  
Laying round in a one-room country shack  
Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed  
Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed  
'Til there's nothing left to see  
'Til the chains have been shattered and I been freed  
But I'm looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above  
looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above  
Rolling through the rain and hail  
Looking for the sunny side of love  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same  
I keep on walking 'til I hear her holler out my name

Bob Dylan,Disease Of Conceit,"There's a whole lot of people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit  
Comes right down the highway straight down the line  
Rips into your senses through your body and your mind  
Nothing about it that's sweet  
The disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Steps into your eats into your soul  
Over your senses you have no control  
Ain't nothing too discreet about the disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of people dying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people crying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Comes right out of nowhere and you're down for the count  
From the outside world the pressure will mount  
Turn you into a piece of meat  
The disease of conceit.  
  
Conceit is the disease that the doctors got no cure  
They've done a lot of research on it but what it is they're still not sure.  
  
There's a whole lot of people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people seeing trouble tonight fro the disease of conceit  
Give you delusions of grandeur an evil eye  
Give you the idea that you're too good to die  
The they bury you from head to feet  
From the disease of conceit.

Early on one frosty morn  
Look away, look away, look away to Dixie Land

Bob Dylan,Do You Hear What I Hear?,"Said the night wind to the little lamb  
Do you see what I see?  
Way up in the sky, little lamb  
Do you see what I see?  
A star, a star, dancing in the night  
With a tail as big as a kite  
With a tail as big as a kite  
  
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear?  
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear?  
A song, a song high above the trees  
With a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea  
  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king  
Do you know what I know?  
In your palace warm, mighty king  
Do you know what I know?  
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold

Listen to what I say!  
Pray for peace, people, everywhere  
Listen to what I say!  
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night  
He will bring us goodness and light  
He will bring us goodness and light

Bob Dylan,Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight,"Just a minute before you leave, girl  
Just a minute before you touch the door  
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?  
Do you think we can talk about it some more?  
You know the streets are filled with vipers  
Who've lost all ray of hope  
You know, it ain't even safe no more  
In the palace of the Pope.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
Come over here from over there, girl  
Sit down here, you can have my chair  
I can't see us going anywhere, girl  
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there  
I wish I'd have been a doctor  
Maybe I'd have saved some life that had been lost  
Maybe I'd have done some good in the world  
'Stead of burning every bridge I crossed.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
I ain't too good at conversation, girl  
So you might not know exactly how I feel  
But if I could, I'd bring you to the mountaintop, girl  
And build you a house made out of stainless steel  
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting  
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches  
But I know that I can't move.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's gone but the past lives on  
Tomorrow's just one step beyond  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
Who are these people who are walking towards you  
Do you know them or will there be a fight?  
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through  
Can they tell you what's wrong from right?  
  
Do you remember St. James Street  
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?  
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet  
And laid his life on the line.  
  
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl  
No more booby traps and bombs  
No more decadence and charm  
No more affection that's been misplaced, girl  
No more mud cake creatures lying in your arms  
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?  
He looked so baffled and bewildered  
When he played and we didn't dance.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.

If you don't know by now  
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn  
Look out your window and I'll be gone  
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on  
Don't think twice, it's all right  
  
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe  
That light I never knowed  
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe  
I'm on the dark side of the road  
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say  
To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talkin' anyway  
So don't think twice, it's all right  
  
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal  
Like you never did before  
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal  
I can't hear you any more  
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road  
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told  
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul  
But don't think twice, it's all right  
  
I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound, I can't tell  
But goodbye's too good a word, gal  
So I'll just say fare thee well  
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind  
You could have done better but I don't mind  
You just kinda wasted my precious time  
But don't think twice, it's all right

"
Bob Dylan,Drifter's Escape,"""Oh, help me in my weakness,""  
I heard the drifter say,  
As they carried him from the courtroom  
And were taking him away.  
""My trip hasn't been a pleasant one  
And my time it isn't long,  
And I still do not know  
What it was that I've done wrong.""  
  
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,  
A tear came to his eye,  
""You fail to understand,"" he said,  
""Why must you even try?""  
Outside, the crowd was stirring,  
You could hear it from the door.  
Inside, the judge was stepping down,  
While the jury cried for more.  
  
""Oh, stop that cursed jury,""  
Cried the attendant and the nurse,  
""The trial was bad enough,  
But this is ten times worse.""  
Just then a bolt of lightning  
Struck the courthouse out of shape,  
And while ev'rybody knelt to pray  
The drifter did escape.

"
Bob Dylan,Dusty Old Fairgrounds,"by Bob Dylan  
  
Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring,  
The trucks and the trailers will be winding  
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route.  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun  
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling  
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands,  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen  
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling  
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana.  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels,  
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing.  
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright.  
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-many a friend that follows the bend,  
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers.  
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents,  
Get that canvas flag a-flying.  
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds  
Just behind the posters that are hanging  
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind,  
Hear that old music box a-banging.  
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town,  
Hit the old highway by the morning  
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime  
Drinking red wine as we're rolling,  
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn  
From following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg  
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em  
And the money that we made will pay for the space  
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.

Bob Dylan,Emotionally Yours,"Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun  
Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one  
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind the closed door  
But I will always be emotionally yours.  
  
Come baby, rock me, come baby, locl me into the shadows of your heart  
Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start  
I could be dreaming but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for  
And I will always be emotionally yours.  
  
It's like my whole life never happened  
When I see you, it's if I never had a thought  
I know this dream, it might be crazy  
But it's the only one I got. Okay.  
  
Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied  
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide  
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores  
But I will always be emotionally yours.

Bob Dylan,Fixin' To Die,"Feelin' funny in my mind Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die  
Feelin' funny in my mind Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die  
Well I don't mind dyin' but I hate to leave my children cryin'  
  
Well look over yonder, to that buryin' ground  
Look over yonder, to that buryin' ground  
Sure seems lonesome, Lord when the sun goes down  
  
Feelin' funny in my eyes Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die, fixin' to die  
Feelin' funny in my eyes Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die  
Well I don't mind dyin' but I hate to leave my children cryin'  
  
Well there's black smoke risin' Lord, it's risin' up above my head, up above
my head  
Well there's black smoke risin' Lord, it's risin' up above my head  
Can tell Jesus, ""Make up my dyin' bed""  
  
Well I'm walkin' kinda funny Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die, fixin' to die  
Yes I'm walkin' kinda funny Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die, fixin' to die,
fixin' to die  
Well I don't mind dyin' but I hate to leave my children cryin'

"
Bob Dylan,Floater,"Down over the window  
From the dazzling sunlit rays  
Through the back alleys, through the blinds  
Another one of them endless days  
  
Honey bees are buzzing  
Leaves begin to stir  
I'm in love with my second cousin  
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her  
  
I keep listening for footsteps  
But I ain't never hearing any  
From the boat, I fish for bullheads  
I catch a lot, sometimes too many  
  
A summer breeze is blowin'  
A squall is setting in  
Sometimes it's just plain stupid  
To get into any kind of wind  
  
Well the old men 'round here  
Sometimes they get on bad terms  
With the younger men,  
Old, young, age don't carry weight  
It doesn't matter in the end  
  
One of the boss' hangers-on  
Sometimes comes to call  
At times you least expect  
Tryin' to bully you, strongarm you,  
Inspire you with fear  
It has the opposite effect  
  
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town  
The old one is long gone  
10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across  
Burns with the bark still on  
  
They say times are hard  
If you don't believe it you can follow your nose  
It don't bother me, times are hard anywhere  
We'll just have to see how it goes  
  
My old man, he's like some feudal lord  
He's got more lives than a cat  
I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once  
Things come alive or they fall flat  
  
You can smell the pine wood burnin'  
You can hear the school bell ring  
Got to get up near the teacher, if you can  
If you wanna learn anything  
  
Romeo, he said to Juliet, you got a poor complexion  
It don't give you an appearance or a youthful touch  
Juliet said back to Romeo,  
Why don't you just shove off,  
If it bothers you so much  
  
They got outta here any way they could  
Cold rain can give you the shivers  
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,  
All the rest of them rebel rivers  
  
If you ever try to interfere with me  
Or cross my path again,  
You do so at the peril of your life  
I'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as I sound  
I've seen enough heartache and strife  
  
My grandfather was a duck trapper,  
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes [?]  
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,  
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.  
  
I had 'em once, though I suppose  
To go along with all the ring dancing,  
Christmas carols and all the Christmas eves  
I left all my dreams and hopes  
Buried under tobacco leaves  
  
Not always easy kicking someone up  
Got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task  
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up  
And tears or not, it's too much to ask.

"
Bob Dylan,Freight Train Blues,"I was born in Dixie in a boomer shack  
Just a little shanty by the railroad track  
Freight train was it taught me how to cry  
Hummin' of the driver was my lullaby  
I got the freight train blues  
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes  
And when the whistle blows I gotta go baby, don't you know  
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.  
  
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my old ma here,  
She was the only daughter of the engineer  
My sweetheart loved a brakeman and it ain't no joke  
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke  
I got the freight train blues  
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes  
And when the whistle blows I gotta go oh mama, don't you know  
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.  
  
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again  
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train  
Every place I want to go  
I never can go, because you know  
I got the freight train blues  
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes.

Bob Dylan,Get Your Rocks Off,"By Bob Dylan  
  
You know, there's two ol' maids layin' in the bed,  
One picked herself up an' the other one, she said:  
""Get your rocks off!  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)""  
  
Well, you know, there late one night up on Blueberry Hill,  
One man turned to the other man and said, with a blood-curdlin' chill, he
said:  
""Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)""  
  
Well, you know, we was layin' down around Mink Muscle Creek,  
One man said to the other man, he began to speak, he said:  
""Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)""  
  
Well, you know, we was cruisin' down the highway in a Greyhound bus.  
All kinds-a children in the side road, they was hollerin' at us, sayin':  
""Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! ""

Bob Dylan,Girl Of The North Country,"If you're travelin' in the North Country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
For she once was a true love of mine  
If you go when the snowflakes storm  
When the rivers freeze and summer ends  
Please see she has a coat so warm  
To keep her from the howlin' winds  
Please see if her hair hangs long  
If it rolls and flows all down her breast  
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long  
For that's the way I remember her best  
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all  
Many times I've often prayed  
In the darkness of my night  
In the brightness of my day  
So if you're travelin' the North Country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
For she once was a true love of mine

Bob Dylan,"Going, Going, Gone","I've just reached a place  
Where the willow don't bend.  
There's not much more to be said  
It's the top of the end.  
I'm going,  
I'm going,  
I'm gone.  
  
I'm closin' the book  
On the pages and the text  
And I don't really care  
What happens next.  
I'm just going,  
I'm going,  
I'm gone.  
  
I been hangin' on threads,  
I been playin' it straight,  
Now, I've just got to cut loose  
Before it gets late.  
So I'm going,  
I'm going,  
I'm gone.  
  
Grandma said, ""Boy, go and follow your heart  
And you'll be fine at the end of the line.  
All that's gold isn't meant to shine.  
Don't you and your one true love ever part.""  
  
I been walkin' the road,  
I been livin' on the edge,  
Now, I've just got to go  
Before I get to the ledge.  
So I'm going,  
I'm just going,  
I'm gone.

Bob Dylan,Golden Loom,"Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,  
I see the sailin' boats across the bay go by.  
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street  
And then I turn my head, for you're approachin' me.  
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter, floatin' in to my room  
With a golden loom.  
  
First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine  
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.  
I see the hungry clouds up above your face  
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste.  
And then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom  
With your golden loom.  
  
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light  
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.  
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail  
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.  
But you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume  
And your golden loom.

"
Bob Dylan,Gonna Change My Way Of Thinking,"Gonna change my way of thinking,  
Make myself a different set of rules.  
Gonna change my way of thinking,  
Make myself a different set of rules.  
Gonna put my good foot forward,  
And stop being influenced by fools.  
  
So much oppression,  
Can't keep track of it no more.  
So much oppression,  
Can't keep track of it no more.  
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers,  
And old men turning young daughters into whores.  
  
Stripes on your shoulders,  
Stripes on your back and on your hands.  
Stripes on your shoulders,  
Stripes on your back and on your hands.  
Swords piercing your side,  
Blood and water flowing through the land.  
  
Well don't know which one is worse,  
Doing your own thing or just being cool.  
Well don't know which one is worse,  
Doing your own thing or just being cool.  
You remember only about the brass ring,  
You forget all about the golden rule.  
  
You can mislead a man,  
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes.  
You can mislead a man,  
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes.  
But there's only one authority,  
And that's the authority on high.  
  
I got a God-fearing woman,  
One I can easily afford.  
I got a God-fearing woman,  
One I can easily afford.  
She can do the Georgia crawl,  
She can walk in the spirit of the Lord.  
  
Jesus said, ""Be ready,  
For you know not the hour in which I come.""  
Jesus said, ""Be ready,  
For you know not the hour in which I come.""  
He said, ""He who is not for Me is against Me,""  
Just so you know where He's coming from.  
  
There's a kingdom called Heaven,  
A place where there is no pain of birth.  
There's a kingdom called Heaven,  
A place where there is no pain of birth.  
Well the Lord created it, mister,  
About the same time He made the earth.

Bob Dylan,Gospel Plow,"Mary wore three links of chain  
Every link was Jesus name  
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.  
  
Mary, Mark, Luke and John  
All these prophets are dead and gone  
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.  
  
Well, I've never been to heaven  
But I've been told streets up there  
Are lined with gold  
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.

Bob Dylan,Handsome Molly,"Well, I wish I was in London,  
Or some other seaport town  
I'd put my foot on a steamboat  
I'd sail the ocean 'round.  
While sailing 'round the ocean,  
While sailing 'round the sea  
I'd think of handsome molly  
Wherever she might be.  
Don't you remember, molly  
You gave me your right hand?  
You said whenever you'd marry  
I would be the man.  
But you broke your promise  
Go with whom you please  
My poor heart is aching  
You are at your ease.  
I went to church last Sunday  
Molly came ridin' by  
I could tell her mind was changin'  
By the rovin' of her eye.  
I go down to the river  
Though everyone's asleep  
I think of handsome molly  
An' I begin to weep.  
So I wish I was in London,  
Or some other seaport town  
I'd put my foot on a steamboat  
I'd sail the ocean 'round.

He been around the world and back again  
Something in the moonlight still hounds him  
Handy dandy, just like sugar and candy  
  
Handy dandy, if every bone in his body was broken he would never admit it  
He got an all girl orchestra and when he says  
""Strike up the band"", they hit it

You say, ""What are ya made of?""  
He says, ""Can you repeat what you said?""

"
Bob Dylan,House Carpenter,"Well met, well met, my own true love  
Well met, well met, cried she  
I've just returned from the salt, salt sea  
And it's all for the love of thee  
  
I could have married a King's daughter there  
She would have married me  
But I have forsaken my King's daughter there  
It's all for the love of thee  
  
Well, if you could have married a King's daughter there  
I'm sure you're the one to blame  
For I am married to a house carpenter  
And I'm sure he's a fine young man  
  
Forsake, forsake your house carpenter  
And come away with me  
I'll take you where the green grass grows  
On the shores of sunny Italy  
  
So up she picked her babies three  
And gave them kisses, one, two, three  
Saying ""take good care of your daddy while I'm gone  
And keep him good company.""  
  
Well, they were sailin' about two weeks  
I'm sure it was not three  
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck  
Sayin' she wants company  
  
""Well, are you weepin' for your house and home?  
Or are you weepin' for your babies three?""  
""Well, I'm not weepin' for my house carpenter  
I'm weepin' for my babies three.""  
  
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love  
They look as white as snow  
Those are the hill of heaven, my love  
You and I'll never know  
  
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love  
They look as dark as night  
Those are the hills of hell-fire my love  
Where you and I will unite  
  
Oh twice around went the gallant ship  
I'm sure it was not three  
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak  
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea

"
Bob Dylan,I Can't Get You Off Of My Mind,"[Chorus]  
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind  
When I try I 'm just wastin' my time  
Lord I've tried and I've tried  
and all night long I've cried  
But I can't get you off of my mind.  
  
Didn't think you would leave me behind  
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind  
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart  
When I can't get you off of my mind.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You believe that a true love is blind  
So you fool ev'ry new love you find  
You've got stars in your eyes but they can't hide the lies  
Oh, I can't get you off my mind.  
  
[Chorus]

Bob Dylan,I Feel A Change Comin' On,"Well I'm lookin' the world over  
Looking far off into the east  
And I see my baby comin'  
She's walking with the village beast  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the last part of the day's already gone  
  
We got so much in common  
We strive for the same old ends  
And I just can't wait  
Wait for us to become friends  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
Well life is for love  
And they say that love is blind  
If you wanna live easy  
Baby, pack your clothes with mine  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
Well now what's the use in dreaming  
You got better things to do  
Dreams never did work for me anyway  
Even when they did come true  
  
You are as porous as ever  
Baby you can start a fire  
I must be losing my mind  
You're the object of my desire  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver  
And I'm reading James Joyce  
Some people they tell me  
I got the blood of the land in my voice  
  
Everybody got all the money  
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes  
Everybody got all the flowers  
I don't have one single rose  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone

Bob Dylan,"If You Gotta Go, Go Now","Listen to me, baby,  
There's something you must see.  
I want to be with you, gal,  
If you want to be with me.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
It ain't that I'm questionin' you.  
To take part in any quiz.  
It's just that I ain't got no watch  
An' you keep askin' me what time it is.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
I am just a poor boy, baby,  
Lookin' to connect.  
But I certainly don't want you thinkin'  
That I ain't got any respect.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
You know I'd have nightmares  
And a guilty conscience, too,  
If I kept you from anything  
That you really wanted to do.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
It ain't that I'm wantin'  
Anything you never gave before.  
It's just that I'll be sleepin' soon,  
It'll be too dark for you to find the door.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.

"
Bob Dylan,In The Summertime,"I was in your presence for an hour or so  
Or was it a day?  
I truly don't know  
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low  
By that soft and shining sea  
Did you respect me for what I did  
Or what I didn't do, or keeping it hid?  
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid  
Of everything you see?  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
I got the heart and you got the blood  
We cut through iron and we cut through mud  
Then came the warning that was before the flood  
That set everybody free  
Fools they made a mock of sin  
Our loyalty they tried to win  
But you were closer to me than my next of kin  
When they didn't want to know or see.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs  
Poverty and shame were theirs  
But all that suffering was not to be compared  
With the glory that is to be  
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave  
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved  
It'll go with me unto the grave  
And into eternity.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.

Bob Dylan,It Takes A Lot To Laugh It Takes A Train To Cry,"Well, I ride on a mailtrain, babe  
Can't buy a thrill  
Well, I've been up all night  
Leanin' on the window sill  
Well, if I die  
On top of the hill  
And if I don't make it  
You know my baby will.  
  
Don't the moon look good, mama  
Shinin' through the trees?  
Don't the brakeman look good, mama  
Flaggin down the ""Double E""?  
Don't the sun look good  
Goin' down over the sea?  
Don't my gal look fine  
When she's comin' after me?  
  
Now the wintertime is coming  
The windows are filled with frost  
I went to tell everybody  
But I could not get across  
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby  
I don't wanna be your boss  
Don't say I never warned you  
When your train gets lost.

Bob Dylan,10.000 Men,"Ten thousand men on a hill,  
Ten thousand men on a hill,  
Some of 'm goin' down, some of 'm gonna get killed.  
  
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,  
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,  
Drummin' in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.  
  
Ten thousand men on the move,  
Ten thousand men on the move,  
None of them doing nothin' that your mama wouldn't disapprove.  
  
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,  
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,  
All clean shaven, all coming in from the cold.  
  
Hey! Who could your lover be?  
Hey! Who could your lover be?  
Let me eat off his head so you can really see!  
  
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,  
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,  
Standin' at my window wishing me goodnight.  
  
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,  
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,  
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.  
  
Ten thousand women all sweepin' my room,  
Ten thousand women all sweepin' my room,  
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.  
  
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea!  
Baby, thank you for my tea!  
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.

"
Bob Dylan,2 X 2,"One by one, they followed the sun,  
One by one, until there were none.  
Two by two, to their lovers they flew,  
Two by two, into the foggy dew.  
Three by three, they danced on the sea,  
Four by four, they danced on the shore,  
Five by five, they tried to survive,  
Six by six, they were playing with tricks.  
  
How many paths did they try and fail?  
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?  
How much poison did they inhale?  
How many black cats crossed their trail?  
Seven by seven, they headed for heaven,  
Eight by eight, they got to the gate,  
Nine by nine, they drank the wine,  
Ten by ten, they drank again.  
  
How many tomorrow's have are they given away?  
How many compared to yesterday?  
How many more without any reward?  
How many more can they afford?  
Two by two, they stepped into the ark,  
Two by two, they step in the dark.  
Three by three, they're turning the key,  
Four by four, they turn it some more,  
One by one, they follow the sun,  
Two by two, to another rendezvous.

Bob Dylan,A Fool Such As I,"Now an' then, there's a fool such as I  
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, when we say goodbye  
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry  
When you're gone I will dream a little dream as years go by  
Now an' then, there's a fool, a fool such as I

"
Bob Dylan,A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?  
And where have you been my darling young one?  
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains  
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways  
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests  
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans  
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?  
And what did you see, my darling young one?  
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it  
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it  
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'  
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'  
I saw a white ladder all covered with water  
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken  
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?  
And what did you hear, my darling young one?  
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'  
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world  
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'  
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'  
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'  
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter  
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard  
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, who did you meet my blue-eyed son?  
Who did you meet, my darling young one?  
I met a young child beside a dead pony  
I met a white man who walked a black dog  
I met a young woman whose body was burning  
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow  
I met one man who was wounded in love  
I met another man who was wounded in hatred  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard  
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?  
And what'll you do now my darling young one?  
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'  
I'll walk to the deepths of the deepest black forest  
Where the people are a many and their hands are all empty  
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters  
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison  
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden  
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten  
Where black is the color, where none is the number  
And I'll tell and think it and speak it and breathe it  
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it  
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'  
But I'll know my songs well before I start singin'  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

"
Bob Dylan,Abandoned Love,"I can hear the turning of the key  
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me.  
I thought that he was righteous but he's vain  
Oh, something's a-telling me I wear the ball and chain.  
  
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost  
He's always off somewhere when I need him most.  
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill  
But my heart is a-tellin' me I love ya still.  
  
I come back to the town from the flaming moon  
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon.  
I love to see you dress before the mirror  
Won't you let me in your room one time 'fore I finally disappear?  
  
Everybody's wearing a disguise  
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes.  
But me, I can't cover what I am  
Wherever the children go I'll follow them.  
  
I march in the parade of liberty  
But as long as I love you I'm not free.  
How long must I suffer such abuse  
Won't you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?  
  
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,  
The pot of gold is only make-believe.  
The treasure can't be found by men who search  
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.  
  
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,  
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list.  
My head tells me it's time to make a change  
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you're strange.  
  
One more time at midnight, near the wall  
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.  
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?  
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.

"
Bob Dylan,Absolutely Sweet Marie,"Well, your railroad gage, you know I just can't jump it  
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see  
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet  
With all these promises you left for me  
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick  
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me  
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic  
When you knew I had some other place to be  
Now where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously  
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately.  
  
Well, six white horses that you did promise  
Were fin'ly delivered down to the penitentiary  
But to live outside the law, you must be honest  
I know you always say that you agree  
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Well I don't know how it happened  
But the river-boat captain he knows my fate  
But ev'rybody else, even yourself  
They're just gonna have to wait.  
  
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets  
The Persian drunkard, he follows me  
Yes, I can take him to your house but I can't unlock it  
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key  
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed  
That a man can't give his address out to bad company  
And now I stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad  
In the ruins of your balcony  
Wond'ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie?

"
Bob Dylan,Ain't No More Cane,"Ain't no more cane on the Brazos  
Oh, oh, oh, oh...  
Its all been ground down to molasses  
Oh, oh- oh, oh- oh...  
  
You shoulda been on the river in 1910  
They were driving the women just like they drove the men.  
  
Go down Old Hannah, don'cha rise no more  
Don't you rise up til Judgment Day's for sure  
  
Ain't no more cane on the Brazos  
Its all been ground down to molasses  
  
Captain, don't you do me like you done poor old Shine  
Well ya drove that bully til he went stone blind  
  
Wake up on a lifetime, hold up your own head  
Well you may get a pardon and then you might drop dead  
  
Ain't no more cane on the Brazos  
Its all been ground down to molasses.

"
Bob Dylan,Ain't Talkin',"As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden  
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine  
I was passing by yon cool crystal fountain  
Someone hit me from behind  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Through this weary world of woe  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
No one on earth would ever know  
  
They say prayer has the power to heal  
So pray from the mother  
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell  
I am a-tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others  
But oh, mother, things ain't going well  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost  
  
Now I'm all worn down by weeping  
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry  
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping  
I'll just slaughter 'em where they lie  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Through the world mysterious and vague  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' through the cities of the plague.  
  
Well, the whole world is filled with speculation  
The whole wide world which people say is round  
They will tear your mind away from contemplation  
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Eatin' hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Some day you'll be glad to have me around.  
  
They will crush you with wealth and power  
Every waking moment you could crack  
I'll make the most of one last extra hour  
I'll revenge my father's death then I'll step back  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Hand me down my walkin' cane.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Got to get you out of my miserable brain.  
  
All my loyal and my much-loved companions  
They approve of me and share my code  
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned  
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
My mule is sick, my horse is blind.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Thinkin' 'bout that gal I left behind.  
  
Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'  
Fame and honor never seem to fade  
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'  
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Carryin' a dead man's shield  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' with a toothache in my heel  
  
The sufferin' is unending  
Every nook and cranny has its tears  
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending  
I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Walkin' ever since the other night.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' 'til I'm clean out of sight.  
  
As I walked out in the mystic garden  
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn  
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon  
There's no one here, the gardener is gone  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Up the road, around the bend.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
In the last outback at the world's end.

"
Bob Dylan,All Along The Watchtower,"""There must be some way out of here,"" said the joker to the thief,  
""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.  
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,  
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth.""  
  
""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,  
""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.  
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,  
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late.""  
  
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view  
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.  
  
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,  
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.

See like me or be like me.

Bob Dylan,Angelina,"Well, it's always been my nature to take chances  
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances  
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances  
To the tune of a concertina  
  
Blood dryin' in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore  
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door  
But whatever it could be, makes you think you've seen me before  
Angelina  
  
Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina  
  
His eyes were two slits that would make a snake proud  
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd  
Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed  
And the head of a hyena  
  
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?  
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?  
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek  
Angelina  
  
Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina  
  
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode  
The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed  
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road  
With your subpoena  
  
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?  
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game  
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same  
Angelina  
  
Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina  
  
There's a black Mercedes rollin' through the combat zone  
Your servants are half dead

Bob Dylan,Are You Ready,"Are you ready, are you ready?  
Are you ready, are you ready?  
  
Are you ready to meet Jesus?  
Are you where you ought to be?  
Will He know you when He sees you  
Or will He say, ""Depart from Me""?  
  
Are you ready, hope you're ready  
Am I ready, am I ready?  
Am I ready, am I ready?  
  
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren  
And to take up my cross?  
Have I surrendered to the will of God  
Or am I still like the boss?  
  
Am I ready, hope I'm ready.  
When the destruction cometh swiftly  
And there's no time to say a fare-thee-well  
Have you decided whether you want to be  
In heaven or in hell?  
  
Are you ready, are you ready?  
Have you got some unfinished business?  
Is there something holding you back?  
Are you thinking for yourself  
Or are you following the pack?  
  
Are you ready, hope you're ready  
Are you ready?  
  
Are you ready for the judgment?  
Are you ready for that terrible swift sword?  
Are you ready for Armageddon?  
Are you ready for the day of the Lord?  
  
Are you ready, I hope you're ready?

"
Bob Dylan,Arthur Mcbride,"Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,  
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,  
Mark now what followed and what did betide,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'  
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp,  
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp  
And a little wee drummer intending to camp,  
For the day bein' pleasant and charmin'.  
  
""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant he cried.  
""And the same to you, gentlemen,"" we did reply,  
Intending no harm but meant to pass by,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'  
""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist,  
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist,  
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,  
And drink the king's health in the morning.  
  
""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life,  
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife,  
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,  
And he always lives pleasant and charmin',  
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,  
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen.  
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean,  
And sup on thin gruel in the morning.""  
  
""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes,  
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose,  
But you dare not change them one night, for you know  
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning,  
And although that we're single and free,  
We take great delight in our own company,  
We have no desire strange places to see,  
Although that your offers are charming.  
  
""And we have no desire to take your advance,  
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance,  
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France,  
Where we would get shot without warning,""  
""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant. ""I'll have no such chat,  
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats,  
For if you insult me with one other word,  
I'll cut off your heads in the morning.""  
  
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,  
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades  
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head  
And bid them take that as fair warning.  
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,  
We flung them as far as we could in the tide,  
""Now take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride,  
""And temper their edge in the mornin'!""  
  
And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,  
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,  
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,  
And bade it a tedious returning,  
And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks.  
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,  
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,  
And left them for dead in the morning.  
  
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,  
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,  
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts  
And bid them look sharp in the mornin'.  
  
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,  
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,  
Mark now what followed and what did betide,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'

"
Bob Dylan,As I Went Out One Morning,"As I went out one morning  
To breathe the air around Tom Paine's,  
I spied the fairest damsel  
That ever did walk in chains.  
I offer'd her my hand,  
She took me by the arm.  
I knew that very instant,  
She meant to do me harm.  
  
""Depart from me this moment,""  
I told her with my voice.  
Said she, ""But I don't wish to,""  
Said I, ""But you have no choice.""  
""I beg you, sir,"" she pleaded  
From the corners of her mouth,  
""I will secretly accept you  
And together we'll fly south.""  
  
Just then Tom Paine, himself,  
Came running from across the field,  
Shouting at this lovely girl  
And commanding her to yield.  
And as she was letting go her grip,  
Up Tom Paine did run,  
""I'm sorry, sir,"" he said to me,  
""I'm sorry for what she's done.""

Bob Dylan,"Baby, I'm In The Mood For You","Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home  
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hear my milk cow moan  
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit the highway road

Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna make a change in this here town  
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna change the world around  
But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said  
Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you.

Bob Dylan,"Baby, Let Me Follow You Down","Spoken intro:  
I first heard this from Ric von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge.  
Ric is a blues guitar player.  
I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.  
  
Baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down  
Well I'll do anything in this God almighty world  
If you just let me follow you down.  
  
Can I come home with you, baby can I come home with you?

Bob Dylan,Ballad For A Friend,"Sad I'm sittin' on the railroad track,  
Watchin' that old smokestack.  
Train is a-leavin' but it won't be back.  
  
Years ago we hang around,  
Watchin' trains roll through the town.  
Now that train is a-graveyard bound.  
  
Where we go up in that North country,  
Lakes and streams and mines so free,  
I had no better friend than he.  
  
Something happened to him that day,  
I thought I heard a stranger say,  
I hung my head and stole away.  
  
A diesel truck was headin' down,  
Pullin' down a heavy load.  
It left him on a Utah road.  
  
They carried him back to his home town,  
His mother cried, his sister moaned,  
Listenin' to them church bells tone.  
  
A diesel truck was rollin' slow,  
Pullin' down a heavy load.  
And it left him on a Utah road.

"
Bob Dylan,Ballad In Plain D,"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.  
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.  
I courted her proudly but now she is gone,  
Gone as the season she's taken.  
  
Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away  
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.  
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,  
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.  
  
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.  
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.  
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone  
By the jealousy of others around her.  
  
For her parasite sister, I had no respect,  
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.  
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect  
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.  
  
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,  
The changes I was going through can't even be used,  
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose  
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.  
  
With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip  
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,  
Noticing not that I'd already slipped  
To a sin of love's false security.  
  
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,  
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,  
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, ""Please,  
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?""  
  
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,  
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.  
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen  
Tumbled all down into pieces.  
  
""The tragic figure!"" her sister did shout,  
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!""  
And I in my armor, turning about  
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.  
  
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound  
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.  
And she in between, the victim of sound,  
Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.  
  
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.  
I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.  
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night  
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.  
  
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.  
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet.  
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met  
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.  
  
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,  
""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""  
And I answer them most mysteriously,  
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?""

"
Bob Dylan,Ballad Of A Thin Man,"You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand  
You see somebody naked and you say, ""Who is that man?""  
You try so hard but you don't understand  
Just what you will say when you get home  
Because something is happening here but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
You raise up your head and you ask, ""Is this where it is?""  
And somebody points to you and says, ""It's his""  
And you say, ""What's mine?"" and somebody else says, ""Well, what is?""  
And you say, ""Oh my God, am I here all alone?""  
But something is happening and you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek  
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak  
And says, ""How does it feel to be such a freak?""  
And you say, ""Impossible!"" as he hands you a bone  
And something is happening here but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks  
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination  
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you to all give a check  
To tax-deductible charity organizations  
  
Ah, you've been with the professors and they've all liked your looks  
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks  
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books  
You're very well-read, it's well-known  
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels  
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels  
And without further notice, he asks you how it feels  
And he says, ""Here is your throat back, thanks for the loan""  
And you know something is happening but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word ""Now""  
And you say, ""For what reason?"" and he says, ""How""  
And you say, ""What does this mean?"" and he screams back, ""You're a cow!  
Give me some milk or else go home""  
And you know something's happening but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Well, you walk into the room like a camel, and then you frown  
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground  
There ought to be a law against you comin' around  
You should be made to wear earphones  
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?

"
Bob Dylan,Bessie Smith,"Bessie was more than just a friend of mine  
We shared the good times with the bad  
Now many a year has passed me by  
I still recall the best thing I ever had  
  
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie  
Oh, See her soon  
Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith  
When I get there I wonder what she'll do  
  
Now all the crazy things I had to try  
Well I tried them all and then some  
But if you're lucky one day you find out  
Where it is you're really comin' from  
  
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie  
Oh, See her soon  
Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith  
When I get there I wonder what she'll do  
  
Now in my day I've made some foolish moves  
But back then, I didn't worry 'bout a thing  
And now again I still wonder to myself  
Was it her sweet love or the way that she could sing  
  
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie  
Oh, See her soon  
Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith  
When I get there I wonder what she'll do  
  
There's so much time has gone right on by  
I didn't think one could be so wrong  
And then one night I was drinkin' and a-thinkin'  
In the bottom of the glass I could see Bessie's face so strong  
  
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie  
Oh, See her soon  
Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith  
When I get there I wonder what she'll do  
  
When she sees me will she know what I've been through?  
Will old times start to feelin' like new?  
When I get there will our love still feel so true?  
Yet all I have, I'll be a-bringin' it to you  
Oh Bessie, sing them old-time blues

Bob Dylan,Big Yellow Taxi,"They pave paradise, they put up a parking lot  
A pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot  
Don't it always go to show  
You never know what you got till it's gone?  
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.  
  
They took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum  
They charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them  
Don't it always go to show  
You never know what you got till it's gone?  
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.  
  
Hey farmer, farmer, put away the D.D.T  
Give me spots on my apples but leave the birds and the bees, please  
Don't it always go to show  
You never know what you got till it's gone?  
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.  
  
Late last night I heard my screen door slam  
A big yellow bulldozer took away the house and land  
Don't it always go to show  
You never know what you got till it's gone?  
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.

Bob Dylan,Billy 1,"There's guns across the river aimin' at ya  
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch ya  
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get ya  
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.  
  
Campin' out all night on the berenda  
Dealin' cards 'til dawn in the hacienda  
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send ya  
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.  
  
Playin' around with some sweet senorita  
Into her dark hallway she will lead ya  
In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya  
Billy, you're so far away from home.  
  
There's eyes behind the mirrors in empty places  
Bullet holes and scars between the spaces  
There's always one more notch and ten more paces  
Billy, and you're walkin' all alone.  
  
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number  
So sleep with one eye open when you slumber  
Every little sound just might be thunder  
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.  
  
Guitars will play your grand finale  
Down in some Tularosa alley,  
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley  
Billy, you're so far away from home.  
  
There's always some new stranger sneakin' glances  
Some trigger-happy fool willin' to take chances  
And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances  
Advances on your spirit and your soul.  
  
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down  
They've hired Pat Garrett to force a showdown.  
Billy, don't it make ya feel so low-down  
To be shot down by the man who was your friend?  
  
Hang on to your woman if you got one  
Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one.  
She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one  
Billy, you been runnin' for so long.  
  
Guitars will play your grand finale  
Down in some Tularosa alley  
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley  
Billy, you're so far away from home.

"
Bob Dylan,Black Diamond Bay,"Up on the white veranda  
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat.  
Her passport shows a face  
From another time and place  
She looks nothing like that.  
And all the remnants of her recent past  
Are scattered in the wild wind.  
She walks across the marble floor  
Where a voice from the gambling room is callin' her to come on in.  
She smiles, walks the other way  
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down  
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.  
""Pardon, monsieur,"" the desk clerk says,  
Carefully removes his fez,  
""Am I hearing you right?""  
And as the yellow fog is lifting  
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor.  
She passes him on the spiral staircase  
Thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador,  
She starts to speak, but he walks away  
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
A soldier sits beneath the fan  
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.  
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.  
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,  
""Can you see anything?""  
Then the Greek appears on the second floor  
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck,  
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,  
Says, ""Open up another deck.""  
But the dealer says, ""Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait,''  
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh  
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.  
He tried to grab the woman's hand,  
Said, ""Here's a ring, it cost a grand.""  
She said, ""That ain't enough.""  
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags  
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.  
She passed the door that the Greek had locked,  
Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do Not Disturb.""  
She knocked upon it anyway  
As the sun went down and the music did play  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
""I've got to talk to someone quick!""  
But the Greek said, ""Go away,"" and he kicked the chair to the floor.  
He hung there from the chandelier.  
She cried, ""Help, there's danger near  
Please open up the door!""  
Then the volcano erupted  
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.  
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner  
Thinking of forbidden love.  
But the desk clerk said, ""It happens every day,""  
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the island slowly sank  
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.  
The dealer said, ""It's too late now.  
You can take your money, but I don't know how  
You'll spend it in the tomb.""  
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear  
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,  
While she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,  
""My darling, je vous aime beaucoup.""  
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray  
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A.,  
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news.  
It seems there was an earthquake that  
Left nothing but a Panama hat  
And a pair of old Greek shoes.  
Didn't seem like much was happening,  
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer.  
Seems like every time you turn around  
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear  
And there's really nothing anyone can say  
And I never did plan to go anyway  
To Black Diamond Bay.

Bob Dylan,Blackjack Davey,"Black Jack Davey come a-riden' on back,  
A-whistlin' loud and merry.  
Made the woods around him ring,  
And he charmed the heart of a lady,  
Charmed the heart of a lady.  
  
""How old are you, my pretty little miss,  
How old are you, my honey""  
She answered to him with a lovin' smile  
""I'll be sixteen come Sunday,  
Be sixteen come Sunday.""  
  
""Come and go with me, my pretty little miss,  
Come and go with me, my honey,  
Take you where the grass grows green,

""Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes  
All made of Spanish leather.  
Get behind me on my horse  
And we'll ride off together,  
We'll both go off together.""  
  
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes  
Made of Spanish leather.  
Got behind him on his horse  
And they rode off together.  
They rode off together.  
  
At night the boss came home  
Inquiring about this lady.  
The servant spoke before she thought,  
""She's been with Black Jack Dave,  
Rode off with Black Jack Davey.""  
  
""Well, saddle for me my coal black stud,  
He's speedier than the gray.  
I rode all day and I'll ride all night,  
And I'll overtake my lady.  
I'll bring back my lady.""  
  
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight,  
Till he came to a river ragin',  
And there he spied his darlin' bride  
In the arms of Black Jack Davey.  
Wrapped up with Black Jack Davey.  
  
""Pull off, pull off them long blue gloves  
All made of the finest leather.  
Give to me your lily-white hand  
And we'll both go home together.  
We'll both go home together.""  
  
Well, she pulled off them long blue gloves  
All made of the finest leather.  
Gave to him her lily-white hand  
And said good-bye forever.  
Bid farewell forever.  
  
""Would you forsake your house and home,  
Would you forsake your baby?  
Would you forsake your husband, too,  
To go with Black Jack Davey.  
Rode off with Black Jack Davey?""  
  
""Well, I'll forsake my house and home,  
And I'll forsake my baby.  
I'll forsake my husband, too,  
For the love of Black Jack Davey.  
Ride off with Black Jack Davey.""  
  
""Last night I slept in a feather bed  
Between my husband and baby.  
Tonight I lay on the river banks  
In the arms of Black Jack Davey,  
Love my Black Jack Davey.""

Bob Dylan,Blood In My Eyes,"Woke up this morning, feeling blue,  
Seen a good-lookin' girl, can I make love with you?

Said, ""Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?""  
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,  
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you.

Bob Dylan,Blue Moon,"Blue moon, you saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own.  
  
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayet for someone I really could care for.  
  
And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold  
I heard someone whisper, ""Please, adore me""  
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold.  
  
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own  
Without a love of my own.

Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's 115Th Dream,"I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land  
I yelled down to Captain Arab, I'll have ya understand,  
Who came running to the deck and said ""Boys! Forget the whale -  
We're goin' over yonder. Cut the engines. Change the sails.""  
""Haul on that bowline!"" we sang that melody,  
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.  
  
""I think I'll call it America."" I said as we hit land.  
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.  
Captain Arab he starting writing out some deeds  
And said ""Let's build us a fort and start buying the place with beads.?  
Just then a cop come down the street crazy as a loon  
And throws us all in jail for carryin' harpoons.  
  
Aw, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how,  
I went lookin' for some help, I walked past a Guernsey cow  
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums  
Where people carried signs around sayin' ""BAN THE BUMS!"".  
I jumped right in line, sayin' ""I hope that I'm not late""  
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.  
  
I went into a restaurant lookin' for the cook -  
I told him I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.  
The waiter he was handsome and he wore a powder blue cape.  
I ordered up some Suzette, I said ""Could you please make that crepe?""  
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat -  
Food was flyin' everywhere - I left without my hat.  
  
I didn't mean to be nosy so I went into a bank  
To try to get some bail for the boys back in the tank.  
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.  
They threw me in the alley, when up comes this girl from France  
Who invited me to her place. I went, but she had a friend  
Who knocked me out an' robbed my boots an' was I on the street again.  
  
I went up to a big house with a U.S. flag upon display.  
I said ""Can you please help me out, I got some friends down the way.""  
The man said ""Get out of here or I'll tear you limb from limb.""  
I said ""You know, they refused Jesus, too."" He said ""You're not him.  
Get out of here before I break your bones. I'm not your pop.""  
I decided to have him arrested and went looking for a cop.  
  
I ran back outside and got into a cab  
I ran out the other door - this English man said ""Fab!""  
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood  
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.  
I ran right through the door like a hobo sailor does,  
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was  
I repeated that all my friends were in jail, with a sigh.  
He gave me his card and said ""Call me if they die.""  
I shook his hand and said goodbye and went back out on the street,  
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.  
A pay phone was ringin' - and it just about blew my mind -  
When I picked it up an' said ""hello"", this foot came through the line!  
  
Well about this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab  
At gettin' any help for my friends and Captain Arab.  
I needed a coin to flip, like either heads or tails,  
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.  
So I hocked my sailor's suit an' I got a coin to flip.  
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship.  
  
Well I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast.  
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past.  
They asked me my name and I said ""Captain Kidd"".  
They believed me but they wanted to know exactly what I did.  
I said ""For the Pope of Eyruke I was employed""  
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid.  
  
Well the last I heard of Arab he was stuck on the side of a whale  
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail,  
But the funniest thing was - as I was leavin' the bay -  
I saw three ships sailing and they were all headed my way.  
So I asked the Captain what his name was an' how come he didn't drive a
truck??  
He said his name was Columbus an' I just said ""Good luck...""

"
Bob Dylan,Boots Of Spanish Leather,"Oh, I'm sailin' away my own true love,  
I'm sailin' away in the morning.  
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,  
From the place that I'll be landing?  
  
No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love,  
There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'.  
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled,  
From across that lonesome ocean.  
  
Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine  
Made of silver or of golden,  
Either from the mountains of Madrid  
Or from the coast of Barcelona.  
  
Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night  
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,  
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss,  
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'.  
  
That I might be gone a long time  
And it's only that I'm askin',  
Is there something I can send you to remember me by,  
To make your time more easy passin'.  
  
Oh, how can, how can you ask me again,  
It only brings me sorrow.  
The same thing I want from you today,  
I would want again tomorrow.  
  
I got a letter on a lonesome day,  
It was from her ship a-sailin',  
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again,  
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.  
  
Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way,  
I'm sure your mind is roamin'.  
I'm sure your heart is not with me,  
But with the country to where you're goin'.  
  
So take heed, take heed of the western wind,  
Take heed of the stormy weather.  
And yes, there's something you can send back to me,  
Spanish boots of Spanish leather.

"
Bob Dylan,Buckets Of Rain,"Buckets of rain  
Buckets of tears  
Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears.  
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,  
I got all the love, honey baby,  
You can stand.  
  
I been meek  
And hard like an oak  
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke.  
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear,  
If you want me, honey baby,  
I'll be here.  
  
Like your smile  
And your fingertips  
Like the way that you move your lips.  
I like the cool way you look at me,  
Everything about you is bringing me  
Misery.  
  
Little red wagon  
Little red bike  
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like.  
I like the way you love me strong and slow,  
I'm takin' you with me, honey baby,  
When I go.  
  
Life is sad  
Life is a bust  
All ya can do is do what you must.  
You do what you must do and ya do it well,  
I'll do it for you, honey baby,  
Can't you tell?

"
Bob Dylan,Call Letter Blues,"Well, I walked all night long  
Listenin' to them church bells tone  
Yes, I walked all night long  
Listenin' to them church bells tone  
Either someone needing mercy  
Or maybe something I've done wrong  
  
Well, your friends come by for you  
I don't know what to say  
Well, your friends come by for you  
I don't know what to say  
I just can't face up to tell 'em  
Honey, you just went away  
  
Well, children cry for mother  
I tell them, ""Mother took a trip""  
Well, children cry for mother  
I tell them, ""Mother took a trip""  
Well, I walk on pins and needles  
I hope my tongue don't slip  
  
Well, I gaze at passing strangers  
In case I might see you  
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers  
In case I might see you  
But the sun goes around the heavens  
And another day just drives on through  
  
Way out in the distance  
I know you're with some other man  
Way out in the distance  
I know you're with some other man  
But that's alright, baby  
You know I always understand  
  
Call girls in the doorway  
All giving me the eye  
Call girls in the doorway  
All giving me the eye  
But my heart's just not in it  
I might as well pass right on by  
  
My ears are ringin'  
Ringin' like empty shells  
My ears are ringin'  
Ringin' like empty shells  
Well, it can't be no guitar player  
It must be convent bells

"
Bob Dylan,Canadee-I-O,"Well, it's all of fair and handsome girl,  
She's all in her tender years.  
She fell in love with a sailor boy,  
It's true she loved him well.  
For to go off to sea with him  
Like she did not know how,  
She longed to see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
So she bargained with the sailor boy,  
All for a piece of gold.  
Straightaway then he led her  
Down into the hold,  
Sayin', ""I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes,  
Your jacket shall be blue.  
You'll see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the other sailors heard the news,  
Well, they fell into a rage,  
And with all the ship's company  
They were willing to engage.  
Saying, ""We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys,  
Overboard we'll throw her.  
She'll never see that seaport town  
Called Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the captain he heard the news,  
Well, he too fell in a rage,  
And with the whole ship's company  
He was willing to engage,  
Sayin', ""She'll stay in sailor's clothes,  
Her color shall be blue,  
She'll see that seaport town  
Call Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when they come down to Canada  
Scarcely 'bout half a year,  
She's married this bold captain  
Who called her his dear.  
She's dressed in silks and satins now,  
She cuts a gallant show,  
Finest of the ladies  
Down Canadee-i-o.  
  
Come, all you fair and tender girls,  
Wheresoever you may be,  
I'd have you to follow your own true love  
Whene'er he goes to sea.  
For if the sailors prove false to you,  
Well, the captain, he might prove true.  
You'll see the honor I have gained  
By the wearing of the blue.

"
Bob Dylan,Can't Wait,"I can't wait  
Wait for you to change my mind  
It's late  
I'm tryin' to walk the line  
  
Well it's way past midnight  
And there's some people all around  
Some on their way up  
Some on their way down  
  
The air burns and I'm tryin to think straight  
And I don't know how much longer I can wait  
I'm your man  
I've tried to recover the sweet love that we knew  
  
You understand  
That my heart can't go on beating without you  
Well your loveliness has wounded me  
I'm reeling from the blow  
  
I wish I knew what it was that keeps me loving you so  
I'm breathin' hard standin' at the gate  
And I don't know how much longer I can wait  
Skies are gray  
  
I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow  
Night or day  
It doesn't matter where I go anymore I just go  
If I ever saw you comin' I don't know what I might do  
  
I'd like to think I could control myself  
But it isn't true  
That's how it is  
When things disintegrate  
  
And I don't know how much longer I can wait  
I'm doomed to love you  
I been rollin' through stormy weather  
I'm thinkin' of you  
  
And all the places we could roam together  
It's mighty funny  
The end of time has just begun  
Oh honey, after all these years you're still the one  
  
Well I'm strollin' through the lonely graveyard of my mind  
I left my life with you  
Somewhere back there along the line  
I thought somehow that I would be spared this day  
  
I don't know how much longer I can wait

"
Bob Dylan,Caribbean Wind,"She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost  
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross.  
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.  
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,  
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain  
By a man who danced on the roof of the embassy.  
  
Was she a child or a woman, I can't say which  
From one to another she could to easily switch  
We went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach.  
Could I been used and played as a pawn?  
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on  
Where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech.  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.  
  
She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore  
She said, ""We got a mutual friend over by the door,  
And you know he's got our best interest in mind.""  
He was well connected but her heart was a snare  
And she had left him to die in there,  
There were payments due and he was a little behind.  
  
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,  
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,  
Street band playing ""Nearer My God to Thee.""  
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring,  
She said, ""I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing  
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree.""  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.  
  
Atlantic City by the cold grey sea  
I hear a voice crying, ""Daddy,"" I always think it's for me,  
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.  
Every new messenger brings evil report  
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short  
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls.  
  
Would I have married her? I don't know, I suppose.  
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes  
But I kept hearing my name and I had to be movin' on.  
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin,  
I saw a house in the country being torn from within.  
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.

"
Bob Dylan,Catch The Wind,"In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty,  
I want to be in the warm heart of your loving mind.  
To feel you all around me,  
And to take your hand along the sand,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When sundown pales the sky,  
I want to hide a while behind your smile,  
And everywhere I look your eyes I find.  
For me to love you now, would be the sweetest thing,  
T'would make me sing,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When rain has hung the leaves with tears,  
I want you near, to kill my fears,  
To help me to leave all my blues behind.  
Standing in your heart is where I want to be  
And long to be,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

"
Bob Dylan,Changing Of The Guards,"Sixteen years,  
Sixteen banners united over the field  
Where the good shepherd grieves.  
Desperate men, desperate women divided,  
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.  
  
Fortune calls.  
I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,  
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.  
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,  
On midsummer's eve, near the tower.  
  
The cold-blooded moon.  
The captain waits above the celebration  
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid  
Whose ebony face is beyond communication.  
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.  
  
They shaved her head.  
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.  
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.  
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,  
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.  
  
I stumbled to my feet.  
I rode past destruction in the ditches  
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.  
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches  
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.  
  
The palace of mirrors  
Where dog soldiers are reflected,  
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,  
The empty rooms where her memory is protected,  
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.  
  
She wakes him up  
Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking  
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.  
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.  
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.  
  
Gentlemen, he said,  
I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,  
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards  
But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination  
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.  
  
Peace will come  
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire  
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall  
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating  
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

"
Bob Dylan,Christmas Blues,"The jingle bells are jingling  
The streets  
Are white with snow  
The happy crowds are mingling  
But there's no one that I know  
  
I'm sure that you'll forgive me  
If I don't enthuse  
I guess  
I've got the Christmas blues  
  
I've done my window shopping  
There's not a store I've missed  
But what's the use of stopping  
When there's no one on your list  
  
You'll know the way I'm feeling  
When you love and you lose  
I guess  
I've got the Christmas blues  
  
When somebody wants you  
Somebody needs you  
Christmas is a joy of joys  
But friends when you're lonely  
You'll find that it's only  
A thing for little girls  
And little boys  
  
May all your days be merry  
Your seasons full of cheer  
But 'til it's January  
I'll just go and disappear  
Oh Santa  
May have brought you  
Some stars for your shoes  
  
But Santa only brought me  
The blues  
Those brightly packaged  
Tinsel covered  
Christmas blues  
  
Oh Santa  
May have brought you  
Some stars for your shoes  
But Santa only brought me  
The blues  
Those brightly packaged  
Tinsel covered

Bob Dylan,Cocaine Blues,"Every time my baby and me we go up town  
Police come and they knock me down  
Cocaine all around my brain  
Hey baby, better come here quick.  
  
This old cocaine is 'bout to make me sick.  
Cocaine all around my brain.  
Yonder comes by baby, she's dressed in red  
She's got a shot-gun, says she's gonna kill me dead.  
  
Cocaine all around my brain  
Hey baby, better come here quick.  
This old cocaine about to make me sick.  
Cocaine all around my brain.  
  
Hey baby, better come here quick  
This old cocaine 'bout to make me sick  
Cocaine all around my brain.  
Early one morning, half past four  
  
Cocaine came knockin' on my door.  
Cocaine all around my brain  
Hey baby, you better come here quick.  
This old cocaine is making me sick.  
  
Cocaine all around my brain.  
Cocaine's for horses and it's not for men  
Doctor said it kill you, but he don't say when.  
Cocaine all around my brain.  
  
Hey baby, you better come here quick.  
This old cocaine about to make me sick.  
Cocaine all around my brain.

Bob Dylan,Coming From The Heart,"By Bob Dylan and Helena Springs  
  
We have got to come together  
How long can we stay apart?  
You may get it maybe never  
But it's coming from the heart.  
  
Your life is full of indecision  
You can't make up your mind.  
We must get it in position  
And move it on down the line.  
  
'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb  
I been on that road too long of a time  
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds  
When I think of the love that I left behind.  
  
Make me up a bed of roses  
And hang them down from the vine  
Of all my loves you've been the closest  
That's ever been on my mind.  
  
Please don't talk about tomorrow  
I'm really not one to care  
This world is filled with too much sorrow  
That nobody's heart should bear.  
  
'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb  
I been on that road too long of a time  
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds  
When I think of the love that I left behind.  
  
Please, please give me indication  
Stop and talk to me  
Like a river that is flowing  
My love will never cease to be.  
  
You will always be my honey  
No one could take your part  
Our love can't be bought with money  
'Cause it's coming from the heart.  
  
'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb  
I been on that road too long of a time  
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds  
When I think of the love that I left behind.

Bob Dylan,Covenant Woman,"Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord  
Way up yonder, great will be her reward.  
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,  
I know I can trust you to stay where you are.  
  
And I just got to tell you  
I do intend  
To stay closer than any friend.  
I just got to thank you  
Once again  
For making your prayers known  
Unto heaven for me  
And to you, always, so grateful  
I will forever be.  
  
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup.  
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up  
And I know He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,  
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you.  
  
And I just got to tell you  
I do intend  
To stay closer than any friend.  
I just got to thank you  
Once again  
For making your prayers known  
Unto heaven for me  
And to you, always, so grateful  
I will forever be.  
  
Covenant woman, intimate little girl  
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world.  
You know we are strangers in a land we're passing through.  
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant too.  
  
And I just got to tell you  
I do intend  
To stay closer than any friend.

"
Bob Dylan,Cross The Green Mountain,"I cross the green mountain  
I sit by the stream  
Heaven blazing in my head  
I, I dreamt a monstrous dream  
  
Something came up  
Out of the sea  
Swept through the land of  
The rich and the free  
  
I look into the eyes  
Of my merciful friend  
And then I ask myself  
Is this the end?  
  
Memories linger  
Sad yet sweet  
And I think of the souls  
In heaven who will be  
  
Alters are burning  
The flames far and wide  
The fool has crossed over  
From the other side  
  
They tip their caps  
From the top of the hill  
You can feel them come  
All brave blood do spill  
  
Along the dim  
Atlantic line  
The rapper's land  
Lasts for miles behind  
  
The lights coming forward  
And the streets are broad  
All must yield  
To the avenging God  
  
The world is old  
The world is great  
Lessons of life  
Can't be learned in a day  
  
I watch and I wait  
And I listen while I stand  
To the music that comes  
From a far better land  
  
Close the eyes of our captain  
Peace may he know  
His long night is done  
The great leader is laid low  
  
He was ready to fall  
He was quick to defend  
Killed outright he was  
By his own men  
  
It's the last day's last hour  
Of the last happy year  
I feel that the unknown  
The world is so dear  
  
Pride will vanish  
And glory will rot  
But virtue lives  
And cannot be forgot  
  
The bells  
Of evening have rung  
There's blasphemy  
On the end of the tongue  
  
Let them say that I walked  
In fair nature's light  
And that I was loyal  
To truth and to right  
  
Serve God and meet your full  
Look upward beyond  
Beyond the darkness that masks  
The surprises of dawn  
  
In the deep green grasses  
And the blood stained woods  
They never dreamed of surrendering  
They fell where they stood  
  
Stars fell over Alabama  
I saw each star  
You're walking in dreams  
Whoever you are  
  
Chilled are the skies  
Keen is the frost  
The ground's froze hard  
And the morning is lost  
  
A letter to mother  
Came today  
Gunshot wound to the breast  
Is what it did say  
  
But he'll be better soon  
He's in a hospital bed  
But he'll never be better  
He's already dead  
  
I'm ten miles outside the city  
And I'm lifted away  
In an ancient light  
That is not of day  
  
They were calm, they were gloomed  
We knew them all too well  
We loved each other more than  
We ever dared to tell

Bob Dylan,Day Of The Locusts,"Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,  
The birdies were flying from tree to tree.  
There was little to say, there was no conversation  
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree.  
And the locusts sang off in the distance,  
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,  
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.  
  
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,  
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.  
I was ready to leave, I was already walkin',  
But the next time I looked there was light in the room.  
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,  
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill,  
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.  
  
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin',  
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees.  
The man standin' next to me, his head was exploding,  
Well, I was prayin' the pieces wouldn't fall on me.  
Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance,  
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,  
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.  
  
I put down my robe, picked up my diploma,  
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive,  
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota,  
Sure was glad to get out of there alive.  
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,  
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
And the locusts sang with a high whinin' trill,  
Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me,  
Singing for me, well, singing for me.

Bob Dylan,Days Of 49,"I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore in that good old golden days  
They call me a bummer and a gin shot too, but what cares I for praise ?  
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign  
And all the people say, ""There goes Tom Moore, in the days of '49""  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
My comrades they all loved me well, a jolly saucy crew  
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true  
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine  
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was New York Jake, the butcher boy, he was always getting tight  
And every time that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight  
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein  
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game  
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same  
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind  
In the game with death Bill lost his breath, in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo, I never will forget  
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet  
One day he fell in a prospect hole, in a roaring bad design  
And in that hole he roared out his soul, in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast  
And I'm left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost  
And I pass by from town to town, they call me a rambling sign  
""There goes Tom Moore, a bummer shore in the days of '49 ""  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.

Bob Dylan,"Dead Man, Dead Man","Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,  
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,  
Never bein' able to separate the good from the bad,  
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,  
It's makin' me feel so bad.  
  
Dead man, dead man,  
When will you rise?  
Cobwebs in your mind,  
Dust in your eyes.  
  
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.  
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?  
The way that you hold your head, cursin' God with every move,  
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,  
What are you tryin' to prove?  
  
Dead man, dead man,  
When will you rise?  
Cobwebs in your mind,  
Dust in your eyes.  
  
The glamor ad the bright lights and the politics of sin,  
The ghetto you build for me is the one you end up in,  
The race of the engine that overrules your heart,  
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,  
Pretending that you're so smart.  
  
Dead man, dead man,  
When will you rise?  
Cobwebs in your mind,  
Dust in your eyes.  
  
What are you tryin' to overpower me with, the doctrine or the gun?  
My back is already to the wall, where can I run?  
The tuxedo that you're wearin', the flower in your lapel,  
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,  
You want to take me down to hell.  
  
Dead man, dead man,  
When will you rise?  
Cobwebs in your mind,  
Dust in your eyes.

Bob Dylan,Death Is Not The End,"When you're sad and lonely  
And you haven't got a friend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And all that you hell sacred  
Falls down and dows not bend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
When you're standing at the cross-roads  
That you cannot comprehend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And all your dreams have vanished  
And you don't know what's up the bend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
When storm clouds gather round you  
And heavy rains descend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And there's nowhere there to comfort you  
With a helping hand to lend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Oh the tree of life is growing  
Where the spirit never dies  
And the bright light of salvation  
Shines in dark and empty skies  
  
When the cities are on fire  
When the burning flesh of men  
Just remember that death is nt the end  
And you search in vain to find  
  
Just one law abiding citizen  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.

Bob Dylan,Delia,"Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,  
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West,  
When she returned, little Delia gone to rest.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned,  
Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Curtis' looking high, Curtis' looking low,  
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,  
Looking for them rounders, looking out for me.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Men in Atlanta, tryin' to pass for white,  
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Judge says to Curtis, ""What's this noise about?""  
""All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out.""  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Curtis said to the judge, ""What might be my fine?""  
Judge says, ""Poor boy, you got ninety-nine.""  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Curtis' in the jail house, drinking from an old tin cup,  
Delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?  
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?  
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.

"
Bob Dylan,Desolation Row,"They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting  
the passports brown  
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in  
town  
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a  
trance  
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in  
his pants  
And the riot squad they're restless, they need somewhere to  
go  
As Lady and I look out tonight, from Desolation Row  
  
Cinderella, she seems so easy, ""It takes one to know one,""  
she smiles  
And puts her hands in her back pockets Bette Davis style  
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning. ""You Belong to Me I  
Believe""  
And someone says, ""You're in the wrong place, my friend, you  
Better leave""  
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go  
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row  
  
Now the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to  
hide  
The fortune telling lady has even taken all her things  
inside  
All except for Cain and Abel and the hunchback of Notre Dame  
  
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain  
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready  
for the show  
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row  
  
Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window for her I feel so  
afraid  
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid  
To her, death is quite romantic she wears an iron vest  
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness  
And though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow  
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row  
  
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood with his memories in a  
trunk  
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk  
He looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette  
  
As he when off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet  
  
Now you would not think to look at him, but he was famous  
long ago  
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row  
  
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup  
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up  
Now his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the  
cyanide hole  
And she also keeps the cards that read, ""Have Mercy on His  
Soul""  
They all play on the penny whistles, you can hear them blow  
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row  
  
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're  
getting ready for the feast  
The Phantom of the Opera a perfect image of a priest  
They're spoon feeding Casanova to get him to feel more  
assured  
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning  
him with words  
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, ""Get Outa Here  
If You Don't Know  
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row""  
  
Now at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew  
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do  
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack  
machine  
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene  
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go  
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row  
  
Praise be to Nero's Neptune the Titanic sails at dawn  
And everybody's shouting, ""Which Side Are You On?""  
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's  
tower  
While calypso singers laugh at them and fishermen hold  
flowers  
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow  
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation row  
  
Yes, I received your letter yesterday (About the time the  
doorknob broke)  
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of  
joke  
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're  
quite lame  
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another  
name  
Right now, I can't read too good, don't send me no more  
letters no  
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row

Bob Dylan,Diamond Joe,"Now There's a man you'll hear about  
Most anywhere you go,  
And his holdings are in Texas  
And his name is Diamond Joe.  
  
And he carries all his money  
In a diamond-studded jar.  
He never took much trouble  
With the process of the law.  
  
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,  
Did offer him my hand,  
He gave a string of horses  
So old they could not stand.  
  
And I nearly starved to death, boys,  
He did mistreat me so,  
And I never saved a dollar  
In the pay of Diamond Joe.  
  
Now his bread it was corn dodger  
And his meat you couldn't chaw,  
Nearly drove me crazy  
With the wagging of his jaw.  
  
And the telling of his story,  
Mean to let you know  
That there never was a rounder  
That could lie like Diamond Joe.  
  
Now, I tried three times to quit him,  
But he did argue so  
I'm still punching cattle  
In the pay of Diamond Joe.  
  
And when I'm called up yonder  
And it's my time to go,  
Give my blankets to my buddies  
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe.

"
Bob Dylan,Dink's Song,"If I had wings like Noah's dove  
I'd fly the river to the one I love  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
I had a man, who was long and tall,  
Moved his body like a cannon ball.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
'Member one evening, it was drizzling rain  
And in my heart I felt an aching pain.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Once I wore my apron low,  
Been a-keep' you away from my door.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Now my apron is up to my chin,  
You pass my door but you never come in.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Muddy river runs muddy 'n' wild,  
You can't care the bloody for my unborn child.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Number nine train ain' done no harm,  
Number nine train take my poor baby home.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Fastest man I ever saw  
Skid Missouri on the way to Arkansas.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

"
Bob Dylan,Dirge,"I hate myself for lovin' you and the weakness that it showed  
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.  
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,  
I hate myself for lovin' you and I'm glad the curtain fell.  
  
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed  
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?  
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,  
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.  
  
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped,  
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.  
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten 'til he's tame,  
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.  
  
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them,  
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.  
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,  
I've paid the price of solitude, but at last I'm out of debt.  
  
Can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me  
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees.  
We stared into each other's eyes 'til one of us would break,  
No use to apologize, what diff'rence would it make?  
  
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine,  
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.  
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,  
I hate myself for lovin' you, but I should get over that.

"
Bob Dylan,Don't Ya Tell Henry,"Don't ya tell Henry  
Apple's got your fly.  
  
I went down to the river on a saturday morn  
A-lookin' around just to see who's born  
I found a little chicken down on his knees  
I went up and yelled to him  
""Please, please, please""  
He said, ""Don't ya tell Henry  
Don't ya tell Henry  
Don't ya tell Henry  
Apple's got your fly"".  
  
I went down to the corner at a-half past ten  
I's lookin' around, I wouldn't say when  
I looked down low, I looked above  
And who did I see but the one I love  
She said, ""Don't ya tell Henry  
Don't ya tell Henry  
Don't ya tell Henry  
Apple's got your fly"".  
  
Now, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve  
A-lookin' around just to see myself  
I spotted a horse and a donkey too  
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few  
The said, ""Don't ya tell Henry  
Don't ya tell Henry  
Don't ya tell Henry  
Apple's got your fly"".  
  
Now, I went down to the pumphouse the other night  
A-lookin around, it was outa sight  
I looked high and low for that big ol' tree  
I did go upstairs but I didn't see nobody but me  
I said, ""Don't ya tell Henry  
Don't ya tell Henry  
Don't ya tell Henry  
Apple's got your fly"".

Down along the cove,

I say, ""Lord, have mercy, mama,  
It sure is good to see you comin' today.""  
  
Down along the cove,  
I spied my little bundle of joy.  
Down along the cove,  
I spied my little bundle of joy.  
She said, ""Lord, have mercy, honey,  
I'm so glad you're my boy!""  
  
Down along the cove,  
We walked together hand in hand.  
Down along the cove,  
We walked together hand in hand.  
Ev'rybody watchin' us go by  
Knows we're in love, yes, and they understand.

Bob Dylan,Down In The Flood,"Crash on the levee, mama,  
Water's gonna overflow,  
Swamp's gonna rise,  
No boat's gonna row.  
Now, you can train on down  
To Williams Point,  
You can bust your feet,  
You can rock this joint.  
But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?  
You're gonna have to find yourself  
Another best friend, somehow.  
  
Now, don't you try an' move me,  
You're just gonna lose.  
There's a crash on the levee  
And, mama, you've been refused.  
Well, it's sugar for sugar  
And salt for salt,  
If you go down in the flood,  
It's gonna be your own fault.  
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?  
You're gonna have to find yourself  
Another best friend, somehow.  
  
Well, that high tide's risin',  
Mama, don't you let me down.  
Pack up your suitcase,  
Mama, don't you make a sound.  
Now, it's king for king,  
Queen for queen,  
It's gonna be the meanest flood  
That anybody's seen.  
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?  
Yes, you're gonna have to find yourself  
Another best friend, somehow.

Lord, I really miss my baby,  
She's in some far-off land.  
  
Well, your streets are gettin' empty,

And your streets are gettin' empty

Lord, Lord I'm a-bound to die tryin'.  
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean  
And we'll leave this ol' highway behind.  
  
Well, the ocean took my baby,  
My baby stole my heart from me.  
Yes, the ocean took my baby,  
My baby took my heart from me.  
She packed it all up in a suitcase,  
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.  
  
So, I'm a-walkin' down your highway  
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.  
Yes, I'm a-walkin' down your highway  
Just as far as my eyes can see.  
From the Golden Gate Bridge  
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.

"
Bob Dylan,Dreamin' Of You,"The light  
In this place  
Is really bad  
Like being  
In the bottom  
Of a stream  
Any minute now  
I'm expecting  
To wake up  
From a dream  
Miss so much  
The softest touch  
Like the grave  
Of some child child  
Who neither wept  
Nor smiled  
I'm hiding my faith  
In the rain  
I've been  
Dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
And it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Somewhere dawn  
Is breaking  
Light is streaking  
Across the floor  
Church bells  
Are ringing  
I wonder who  
They're ringing for  
Travel under any star  
You'll see me  
Wherever you are  
  
The shadowy past  
Is so vague and so vast  
I'm sleeping  
In the balance of pain  
I've been dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Maybe they'll get me  
Maybe they won't  
But whatever  
It won't be tonight  
I wish your hand  
Was in mine right now  
We could go  
Where the moon is wide  
  
For years  
They had me  
Locked in a cage  
Then they threw me  
Onto the stage  
Somethings  
Just last longer  
Then you  
Thought they would  
And they never  
Ever explain  
I'm dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
And it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Well  
I eat when I'm hungry  
Drink when I'm dry  
Live my life  
On the square  
Even if the flesh  
Falls off my face  
It won't matter as long  
As you're there  
  
Feel like  
A ghost in love  
Underneath  
The heavens above  
Feel further away  
Then I ever did before  
Feel further  
Than I can take  
Dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Everything in the way  
Is so shy like the day  
In queer and unusual form  
Spirals of golden haze here  
In there in a blaze  
Like beams of light  
In a star  
  
Maybe you're here  
Or maybe you weren't  
Maybe you  
Touched somebody  
And got burned  
The silent sun  
Has got me on the run  
Burning a hole  
In my brain  
I'm dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane

"
Bob Dylan,Driftin' Too Far From Shore,"I didn't know that you'd be leavin'  
Or who you thought you were talkin' to.  
I figure maybe we're even  
Or maybe I'm one up on you.  
  
I send you all my money  
Just like I did before.  
I tried to reach you honey,  
But you're driftin' too far from shore.  
  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
  
I ain't gonna get lost in this current,  
I don't like playing cat and mouse.  
No gentleman likes making love to a servant.  
Especially when he's in his father's house.  
  
I never could guess your weight, baby,  
Never needed to call you my whore.  
I always thought you were straight, baby,  
But you're driftin' too far from shore.  
  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
  
Well these times and these tunnels are haunted,  
The bottom of the barrel is too.  
I waited years sometimes for what I wanted.  
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.  
  
Never no more do I wonder,  
Why you don't never play with me any more.  
At any moment you could go under,  
Cause you're driftin' too far from shore.  
  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
  
You and me we had completeness,  
I give you all of what I could provide  
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,  
We were the wrong side.  
  
I've already ripped out the phones, honey.  
You can't walk the streets in a war.  
I can finish this alone, honey,  
You're driftin' too far from shore.

"
Bob Dylan,Duquesne Whistle,"Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away  
I wanna stop at Carmangale and keep on going  
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day  
  
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp  
But I ain't neither one  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Sounding like it's on a final run  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like she never blowed before  
Little light blinking, red light glowing  
Blowing like she's at my chamber door  
  
You smiling through the fence at me  
Just like you always smiled before  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more  
  
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?  
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart  
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going  
You're like a time bomb in my heart  
  
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling  
Must be the mother of our Lord  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like my woman's on board  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away  
You old rascal, I know exactly where you're going  
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day  
  
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed  
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead  
  
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?  
Blowing through another no good town  
  
The lights on my native land are glowing  
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round  
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing  
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like she's blowing right on time

"
Bob Dylan,Early Morning Rain,"In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand  
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand  
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so  
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.  
  
Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go  
I'm stuck here on the ground, where the cold winds blow  
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast  
There she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last.  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high  
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly  
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time.  
  
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me  
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunks as I might be  
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train  
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain.

"
Bob Dylan,Early Roman Kings,"All the early Roman kings  
In their sharkskin suits  
Bow ties and buttons  
High top boots  
Drivin' the spikes in  
Blazin' the rails  
Nailed in their coffins  
In top hats and tails  
  
Fly away, little bird  
Fly away, flap your wings  
Fly by night  
Like the early Roman kings  
  
All the early Roman kings  
In the early, early morn  
Coming down the mountain  
Distributing the corn  
Speeding through the forest  
Racing down the track  
You try to get away  
They drag you back  
  
Tomorrow is Friday  
We'll see what it brings  
Everybody's talking  
'Bout the early Roman kings  
  
They're peddlers and they're meddlers  
They buy and they sell  
They destroyed your city  
They'll destroy you as well  
They're lecherous and treacherous  
Hell-bent for leather  
Each of 'em bigger  
Than all men put together  
  
Sluggers and muggers  
Wearing fancy gold rings  
All the women goin' crazy  
For the early Roman kings  
  
I can dress up your wounds  
With a blood-clotted rag  
I ain't afraid to make love  
To a bitch or a hag  
If you see me comin'  
And you're standing there  
Wave your handkerchief  
In the air  
  
I ain't dead yet  
My bell still rings  
I keep my fingers crossed  
Like them early Roman kings  
  
I can strip you of life  
Strip you of breath  
Ship you down  
To the house of death  
One day  
You will ask for me  
There'll be no one else  
That you'll wanna see  
  
Bring down my fiddle  
Tune up my strings  
I'm gonna break it wide open  
Like the early Roman kings  
  
I was up on black mountain  
The day Detroit fell  
They killed 'em all off  
And they sent 'em to hell  
Ding dong daddy  
You're coming up short  
Gonna put you on trial  
In a Sicilian court  
  
I've had my fun  
I've had my flings  
Gonna shake 'em all down  
Like the early Roman kings

"
Bob Dylan,Endless Highway,"Take a silver dollar and put it in your pocket,  
Never let it slip away.  
Always be a man, not a boy gone astray.  
When ya get half cra-zy from the August heat  
Or on a frozen, rotted road  
With no one to complain to about your achin' feet.  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're gonna walk that endless highway,  
Walk that high-way till you die.  
All you children goin' my way,  
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye.  
  
When I see a detour up ahead,  
Well, I leave it far behind,  
Who knows what you're apt to find there.  
With the cost of livin, and the price of dyin',  
Well it look like t'me this time I wont be buyin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When they get a scapegoat by the throat,  
it's hard labour and cold beans.  
If ya get away real quick,  
You'll be eatin from the poison peanut machine.  
Well, I sing by night, wander by day.  
I'm on the road and it looks like I'm here to stay.  
  
[Chorus]

"
Bob Dylan,Eternal Circle,"I sang the song slowly  
As she stood in the shadows  
She stepped to the light  
As my silver strings spun  
She called with her eyes  
To the tune I's a-playin'  
But the song it was long  
And I'd only begun  
  
Through a bullet of light  
Her face was reflectin'  
The fast fading words  
That rolled from my tongue  
With a long-distance look  
Her eyes was on fire  
But the song it was long  
And there was more to be sung.  
  
My eyes danced a circle  
Across her clear outline  
With her head tilted sideways  
She called me again  
As the tune drifted out  
She breathed hard through the echo  
But the song it was long  
And it was far to the end  
  
I glanced at my guitar  
And played it pretendin'  
That of all the eyes out there  
I could see none  
As her thoughts pounded hard  
Like the pierce of an arrow  
But the song it was long  
And it had to get done  
  
As the tune finally folded  
I laid down the guitar  
Then looked for the girl  
Who'd stayed for so long  
But her shadow was missin'  
For all of my searchin'  
So I picked up my guitar  
And began the next song

"
Bob Dylan,Eve Of Destruction,"The eastern world it is explodin'  
Violence flarin', bullets loadin'  
You're old enough to kill but not for votin'  
You don't believe in war, what's that gun you're totin'  
And even the Jordan river has bodies floatin'  
  
But you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
  
Don't you understand, what I'm trying to say?  
Can't you feel the fears that I'm feeling today?  
If the button is pushed, there's no running away  
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave  
Take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy  
  
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
  
Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin'  
I'm sittin' here, just contemplatin'  
I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation  
Handful of Senators don't pass legislation  
And marches alone can't bring integration  
When human respect is disintegratin'  
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin'  
  
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
  
Think of all the hate there is in Red China  
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama  
Ah, you may leave here, for four days in space  
But when your return, it's the same old place  
The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace  
You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace  
Hate your next-door-neighbor, but don't forget to say grace  
  
And you tell me over and over and over and over again my friend  
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

"
Bob Dylan,Every Grain Of Sand,"In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need  
When the pool of tears beneath my feet floods every newborn seed  
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere  
Toiling in the danger and the morals of despair  
  
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake  
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break  
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand  
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand  
  
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear  
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer  
The sun beams down upon the steps of time to light the way  
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay  
  
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame  
And every time I pass that way I'll always hear my name  
Then onward in my journey I come to understand  
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand  
  
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night  
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light  
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space  
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face  
  
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea  
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me  
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man  
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand

"
Bob Dylan,Everything Is Broken,"Broken lines, broken strings,  
Broken threads, broken springs,  
Broken idols, broken heads,  
People sleeping in broken beds.  
Ain't no use jiving  
Ain't no use joking  
Everything is broken.  
  
Broken bottles, broken plates,  
Broken switches, broken gates,  
Broken dishes, broken parts,  
Streets are filled with broken hearts.  
Broken words never meant to be spoken,  
Everything is broken.  
  
Bridge: Seem like every time you stop and turn around  
Something else just hit the ground  
  
Broken cutters, broken saws,  
Broken buckles, broken laws,  
Broken bodies, broken bones,  
Broken voices on broken phones.  
Take a deep breath, feel like you're chokin',  
Everything is broken.  
  
Bridge: Every time you leave and go off someplace  
Things fall to pieces in my face  
  
Broken hands on broken ploughs,  
Broken treaties, broken vows,  
Broken pipes, broken tools,  
People bending broken rules.  
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,  
Everything is broken.

"
Bob Dylan,Farewell,"Oh it's fare thee well my darlin' true,  
I'm leavin' in the first hour of the morn.  
I'm bound off for the bay of Mexico  
Or maybe the coast of Californ.  
So it's fare thee well my own true love,  
We'll meet another day, another time.  
It ain't the leavin'  
That's a-grievin' me  
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.  
  
Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard  
And the rain she's a-turnin' into hail.  
I still might strike it lucky on a highway goin' west,  
Though I'm travelin' on a path beaten trail.  
So it's fare thee well my own true love,  
We'll meet another day, another time.  
It ain't the leavin'  
That's a-grievin' me  
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.  
  
I will write you a letter from time to time,  
As I'm ramblin' you can travel with me too.  
With my head, my heart and my hands, my love,  
I will send what I learn back home to you.  
So it's fare thee well my own true love,  
We'll meet another day, another time.  
It ain't the leavin'  
That's a-grievin' me  
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.  
  
I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles,  
Be them somebody else's or my own.  
With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high,  
I will travel unnoticed and unknown.  
So it's fare thee well my own true love,  
We'll meet another day, another time.  
It ain't the leavin'  
That's a-grievin' me  
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.  
  
I've heard tell of a town where I might as well be bound,  
It's down around the old Mexican plains.  
They say that the people are all friendly there  
And all they ask of you is your name.  
So it's fare thee well my own true love,  
We'll meet another day, another time.  
It ain't the leavin'  
That's a-grievin' me  
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.

"
Bob Dylan,Farewell Angelina,"Farewell Angelina  
The bells of the crown  
Are being stolen by bandits  
I must follow the sound  
The triangle tingles  
And the trumpet play slow  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is on fire  
And I must go.  
  
There's no need for anger  
There's no need for blame  
There's nothing to prove  
Ev'rything's still the same  
Just a table standing empty  
By the edge of the sea  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is trembling  
And I must leave.  
  
The jacks and queens  
Have forsaked the courtyard  
Fifty-two gypsies  
Now file past the guards  
In the space where the deuce  
And the ace once ran wild  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is folding  
I'll see you in a while.  
  
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting  
Perched in the sun  
Shooting tin cans  
With a sawed-off shotgun  
And the neighbors they clap  
And they cheer with each blast  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky's changing color  
And I must leave fast.  
  
King Kong, little elves  
On the rooftoops they dance  
Valentino-type tangos  
While the make-up man's hands  
Shut the eyes of the dead  
Not to embarrass anyone  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is embarrassed  
And I must be gone.  
  
The machine guns are roaring  
The puppets heave rocks  
The fiends nail time bombs  
To the hands of the clocks  
Call me any name you like  
I will never deny it  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is erupting  
I must go where it's quiet.

"
Bob Dylan,Father Of Night,"Father of night, Father of day,  
Father, who taketh the darkness away,  
Father, who teacheth the bird to fly,  
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,  
Father of loneliness and pain,  
Father of love and Father of rain.  
  
Father of day, Father of night,  
Father of black, Father of white,  
Father, who build the mountain so high,  
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,  
Father of time, Father of dreams,  
Father, who turneth the rivers and streams.  
  
Father of grain, Father of wheat,  
Father of cold and Father of heat,  
Father of air and Father of trees,  
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,  
Father of minutes, Father of days,  
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.

"
Bob Dylan,Folsom Prison Blues,"I hear that train a-rolling, it's a-rolling round the bend  
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when  
I'm stucked in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on  
And I hear that whistle blowing all down to San Antone  
  
When I was just a baby my momma told me: son  
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns  
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
When I hear that train a-pulling I hang my head and cry  
  
I bet there's rich folks eating in their fancy dining cars  
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars  
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free  
But the people keep a-moving, and that's what tortures me  
  
If they'd free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine  
You bet I moved it on a little further down the line  
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stay  
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

"
Bob Dylan,Foot Of Pride,"Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man  
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male  
They sang ""Danny Boy"" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer  
Preacher talking 'bout Christ betrayed  
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up  
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground  
You know what they say about bein' nice to the right people on the way up  
Sooner or later you gonna meet them comin' down  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Hear ya got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names  
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed  
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine  
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed  
Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger  
And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn  
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion  
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
There's a retired businessman named Red, cast down from heaven and he's out of
his head  
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch  
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash  
He's not somebody that you play around with much  
Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is  
She'll do wondrous works with your fate  
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed  
If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave.  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Well they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight  
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors  
How to enter into the gates of paradise  
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours  
Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks  
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks  
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in  
Sing ""Amazing Grace"" all the way to the Swiss banks  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
They got some beautiful people out there, man  
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue  
They got mystery written all over their forehead  
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young  
They don't believe in mercy  
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see  
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route  
Turn you into anything that they want you to be  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Yes, I guess I loved him too  
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill  
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped  
Struck down by the strength of the will  
Ain't nothin' left here partner, just the dust of a plague that has left this
whole town afraid  
From now on, this'll be where you're from  
Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come  
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back

"
Bob Dylan,Forever Young,"May God bless and keep you always  
May your wishes all come true  
May you always do for others  
And let others do for you  
May you build a ladder to the stars  
And climb on every rung  
May you stay forever young  
Forever young, forever young  
May you stay forever young.  
  
May you grow up to be righteous  
May you grow up to be true  
May you always know the truth  
And see the lights surrounding you  
May you always be courageous  
Stand upright and be strong  
May you stay forever young  
Forever young, forever young  
May you stay forever young.  
  
May your hands always be busy  
May your feet always be swift  
May you have a strong foundation  
When the winds of changes shift  
May your heart always be joyful  
And may your song always be sung  
May you stay forever young  
Forever young, forever young  
May you stay forever young.

"
Bob Dylan,Forgetful Heart,"Forgetful heart  
Lost your power of recall  
Every little detail  
You don't remember at all  
The times we knew  
Who would remember better than you?  
  
Forgetful heart  
We laughed and had a good time, you and I  
It's been so long  
Now you're content to let the days go by  
When you were there  
You were the answer to my prayer  
  
Forgetful heart  
We loved with all the love that life can give  
What can I say?  
Without you it's so hard to live  
Can't take much more  
Why can't we love like we did before?  
  
Forgetful heart  
Like a walking shadow in my brain  
All night long  
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain  
The door has closed forevermore  
If indeed there ever was a door

A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, Uh-huh.  
  
A little piece of cornbread layin' on a shelf, Uh-huh,

Bob Dylan,From A Buick 6,"I got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kids  
But my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid  
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me the bread  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge  
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge  
And then she comes down the thruway, ready to sew me up with a thread  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much  
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch  
She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well, you know I need a steam shovel, mama, to keep away the dead  
I need a dump truck, baby, to unload my head  
She brings me everything and more, and just like I said  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed

"
Bob Dylan,Full Moon And Empty Arms,"Full moon and empty arms  
The moon is there for us to share  
But where are you?  
  
A night like this  
Could weave a memory  
And every kiss  
Could start a dream for two  
  
Full moon and empty arms  
Tonight I'll use the magic moon to wish upon  
And next full moon  
If my one wish comes true  
My empty arms will be filled with you  
  
Full moon and empty arms  
Tonight I'll use the magic moon to wish upon  
And next full moon  
If my one wish comes true  
My empty arms will be filled with you

"
Bob Dylan,Gates Of Eden,"Of war and peace the truth just twists  
Its curfew gull just glides  
Upon four-legged forest clouds  
The cowboy angel rides  
With his candle lit into the sun  
Though its glow is waxed in black  
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden  
  
The lamppost stands with folded arms  
Its iron claws attached  
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail  
Though it shadows metal badge  
All and all can only fall  
With a crashing but meaningless blow  
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden  
  
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand  
And then complains  
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf  
But still remains  
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay  
At ships with tattooed sails  
Heading for the Gates of Eden  
  
With a time-rusted compass blade  
Aladdin and his lamp  
Sits with Utopian hermit monks  
Side saddle on the Golden Calf  
And on their promises of paradise  
You will not hear a laugh  
All except inside the Gates of Eden  
  
Relationships of ownership  
They whisper in the wings  
To those condemned to act accordingly  
And wait for succeeding kings  
And I try to harmonize with songs  
The lonesome sparrow sings  
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The motorcycle black Madonna  
Two-wheeled gypsy queen  
And her silver-studded phantom cause  
The gray flannel dwarf to scream  
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey  
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins  
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The kingdoms of experience  
In the precious wind they rot  
While paupers change possessions  
Each one wishing for what the other has got  
And the princess and the prince  
Discuss what's real and what is not  
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The foreign sun, it squints upon  
A bed that is never mine  
As friends and other strangers  
From their fates try to resign  
Leaving men wholly, totally free  
To do anything they wish to do but die  
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden  
  
At dawn my lover comes to me  
And tells me of her dreams  
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse  
Into the ditch of what each one means  
At times I think there are no words  
But these to tell what's true  
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

"
Bob Dylan,George Jackson,"I woke up this mornin',  
There were tears in my bed.  
They killed a man I really loved  
Shot him through the head.  
Lord, Lord,  
They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
Sent him off to prison  
For a seventy-dollar robbery.  
Closed the door behind him  
And they threw away the key.  
Lord, Lord, They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
He wouldn't take shit from no one  
He wouldn't bow down or kneel.  
Authorities, they hated him  
Because he was just too real.  
Lord, Lord,  
They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
Prison guards, they cursed him  
As they watched him from above  
But they were frightened of his power  
They were scared of his love.  
Lord, Lord,  
So they cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
Sometimes I think this whole world  
Is one big prison yard.  
Some of us are prisoners  
The rest of us are guards.  
Lord, Lord,  
They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.

Bob Dylan,Goin' To Acapulco,"I'm going down to Rose Marie's  
She never does me wrong.  
She puts it to me plain as day  
And gives it to me for a song.  
  
It's a wicked life but what the hell  
The stars ain't falling down.  
I'm standing outside the Taj Mahal

'Bout a quarter after three.

And I ain't complainin' none.  
If the clouds don't drop and the train don't stop

I just say no thanks.  
I try to tell it like it is  
And keep away from pranks.  
  
Well, sometime you know when the well breaks down  
I just go pump on it some.  
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places  
And just set there waitin' for me to come.  
  
Goin' to Acapulco  
Goin' on the run.  
Goin' down to see some girl  
Goin' to have some fun.  
Yeah

It may be some place, baby, you say you where  
I had a dream about you, baby  
A dream about you, baby  
Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.  
  
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk  
You make me nervous when you start to talk  
I had a dream about you, baby  
A dream about you, baby

Wearing a long dress fire engine red

Bob Dylan,Hard Times,"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears  
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.  
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.  
There are frail forms fainting at the door.  
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
There's pale drooping maiden who foils her life away  
With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er.  
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

Bob Dylan,Hard Times In New York Town,"Come you ladies and you gentlemen, a-listen to my song.  
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong.  
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell  
'Bout an east coast city that you all know well.  
  
It's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Old new york city is a friendly old town,  
From Washington heights to Harlem on down.  
There's a-mighty many people all millin' all around,  
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.  
  
It's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate  
To Rockefeller plaza n' the Empire State.  
Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird,  
Old mister empire never says a word.  
  
It's hard times from the country,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Well, it's up in the mornin' tryin' to fins a job of work.  
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.  
If you go a lot o' money you can make yourself merry,  
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten island ferry.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Mister Hudson come a-sailin' down the stream  
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream.  
Bought your city on a one-way track,  
If I had my way I'd sell it right back.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
I'll take all the smog in California  
'N every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains,  
'N the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines.  
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
So all you newsy people, spreadin' the news around,  
You see'n listen to m' story, listen to m' song.  
You see'n step on my name, you see'n try 'n' get me beat,  
When I leave New York, I'll be standin' on my feet.  
  
Hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.

Don't let her see  
Don't let her see that you need her  
Don't put yourself over the line  
Heart of mine.  
  
Heart of mine go back where you have been  
It'll only be trouble for you if you let her in  
Don't let her hear  
Don't let her hear you want her  
Don't let her hear know she's so fine  
Heart of mine.  
  
Heart of mine you know that she'll never be true  
She'll only give to others the love that she's gotten from you  
Don't let her know  
Don't let her know where you're going  
Don't untie the ties that bind  
Heart of mine.  
  
Hear of mine so malicious and so full of guile  
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile  
Don't let yourself fall  
Don't let yourself stumble  
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime  
Heart of mine.

Bob Dylan,Here Comes Santa Claus,"Here comes Santa Claus  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Right down  
Santa Claus Lane  
  
Vixen, Blitzen  
And all his reindeer  
Pulling on the reins  
Bells are ringing  
Children singing  
All is merry and bright  
Hang your stockings  
And say your prayers  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Comes tonight  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Right down  
Santa Claus Lane  
  
He's got a bag  
That's filled with toys  
For boys and girls again  
Hear those sleigh bells  
Jingle jangle  
What a beautiful sight  
Jump in bed  
Cover up your head  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Comes tonight  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Right down  
Santa Claus Lane  
  
He doesn't care  
If you're rich or poor  
He loves you just the same

That we're God's children  
That makes everything right  
Fill your hearts  
With Christmas cheer

Peace on Earth  
Will come to all  
If we  
Just follow the light  
Let's give thanks  
To the Lord above  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Is comin' tonight  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Is comin' tonight  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Is comin' tonight

Bob Dylan,Hero Blues,"By Bob Dylan  
  
Yes, the gal I got  
I swear she's the screaming end  
She wants me to be a hero  
So she can tell all her friends  
  
Well, she begged, she cried  
She pleaded with me all last night  
Well, she begged, she cried  
She pleaded with me all last night  
She wants me to go out  
And find somebody to fight  
  
She reads too many books  
She got new movies inside her head  
She reads too many books  
She got movies inside her head  
She wants me to walk out running  
She wants me to crawl back dead  
  
You need a different kinda man, babe  
One that can grab and hold your heart  
Need a different kind of man, babe  
One that can hold and grab your heart  
You need a different kind of man, babe  
You need Napoleon Boneeparte  
  
Well, when I'm dead  
No more good times will I crave  
When I'm dead  
No more good times will I crave  
You can stand and shout hero  
All over my lonesome grave

Bob Dylan,Highway 51,"Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door  
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door  
If I don't get the girl I'm loving  
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more.  
  
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand  
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand  
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.  
  
Well, if I should die before my time should come  
And if I die before my time should come  
Won't you bury my body out on the Highway 51.  
  
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door  
I said, Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door  
If I don't get the girl I'm loving  
Won't go own to Highway 51 no more.

Bob Dylan,Highway 61 Revisited,"Oh, God said to Abraham, ""Kill me a son""  
Abe said, ""Man, you must be puttin' me on""  
God said, ""No"" Abe say, ""What?""  
God say, ""You can do what you want, Abe, but  
The next time you see me comin', you better run""  
Well, Abe said, ""Where d'you want this killin' done?""  
God said, ""Out on Highway 61""  
  
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose  
Welfare department, they wouldn't give him no clothes  
He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?""  
Howard said, ""There's only one place I know""  
Sam said, ""Tell me quick, man, I got to run""  
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun  
And said, ""That way, down Highway 61""  
  
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King  
""I got forty red-white-and-blue shoestrings  
And a thousand telephones that don't ring  
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?""  
And Louie the King said, ""Let me think for a minute, son""  
Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done  
Just take everything down to Highway 61""  
  
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night  
Told the first father that things weren't right  
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""  
He said, ""Come here and step into the light""  
He said, ""Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done""  
But the second mother was with the seventh son  
And they were both out on Highway 61  
  
Now, the roving gambler he was very bored  
Trying to create a next world war  
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor  
He said, ""I never engaged in this kind of thing before  
But yes, I think it can be very easily done  
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun  
And have it on Highway 61""

"
Bob Dylan,Honest With Me,"Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps  
Some of these women they just give me the creeps  
I'm avoidin' the Southside the best I can  
These memories I got, they can strangle a man  
  
Well I came ashore in the dead of the night  
Lot of things can get in the way when you're tryin' to do what's right  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
You'd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
I'm not sorry for nothin' I've done  
I'm glad I fought - I only wish we'd won  
The Siamese twins are comin' to town  
People can't wait - they're gathered around  
  
When I left my home the sky split open wide  
I never wanted to go back there - I'd rather have died  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
You'd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
My woman got a face like a teddy bear  
She's tossin' a baseball bat in the air  
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword  
I'm crashin' my car, trunk first into the boards  
  
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice  
Well, I'll sell it to ya at a reduced price  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
You'd be honest with me, if only you knew  
  
Some things are too terrible to be true  
I won't come here no more if it bothers you  
The Southern Pacific leaving at nine forty-five  
I'm having a hard time believin' some people were ever alive  
  
I'm stark naked, but I don't care  
I'm going off into the woods, I'm huntin' bare  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
I'm here to create the new imperial empire  
I'm going to do whatever circumstances require  
I care so much for you - didn't think that I could  
I can't tell my heart that you're no good  
  
Well, my parents they warned me not to waste my years  
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew

Bob Dylan,Honey Just Allow Me One More Chance,"Honey, just allow me one more chance  
To get along with you.  
Honey, just allow me one more chance,  
Ah'll do anything with you.  
Well, I'm a-walkin' down the road  
With my head in my hand,  
I'm lookin' for a woman  
Needs a worried man.  
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,  
'Low me just-a one more chance.  
  
Honey, just allow me one more chance  
To ride your aeroplane.  
Honey, just allow me one more chance  
To ride your passenger train.  
Well, I've been lookin' all over  
For a gal like you,  
I can't find nobody  
So you'll have to do.  
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,  
'Low me just-a one more chance.  
  
Honey, just allow me one more chance  
To get along with you.  
Honey, just allow me one more chance,  
Ah'll do anything with you.  
Well, lookin' for a woman  
That ain't got no man,  
Is just lookin' for a needle  
That is lost in the sand.  
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,  
'Low me just-a one more chance.

"
Bob Dylan,House Of The Rising Sun,"There is a house down in New Orleans  
They call the rising sun  
And it's been the ruin of many poor girl  
And me, oh God, I'm one.  
  
My mother was a tailor  
She sowed these new blue jeans  
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord  
Down in New Orleans.  
  
Now the only thing a gambler needs  
Is a suitcase and a trunk  
And the only time he's satisfied  
Is when he's on a drunk.  
  
He fills his glasses up to the brim  
And he'll pass the cards around  
And the only pleasure he gets out of life  
Is rambling from town to town.  
  
Oh tell my baby sister  
Not to do what I have done  
But shun that house in New Orleans  
They call the rising sun.  
  
Well it's one foot on the platform  
And the other foot on the train  
I'm going back to New Orleans  
To wear that ball and chain.  
  
I'm going back to New Orleans  
My race is almost run  
I'm going back to end my life  
Down in the rising sun.  
  
There is a house in New Orleans  
They call the rising sun  
It's been the ruin of many poor girl  
And me, oh God, I'm one.

"
Bob Dylan,Huck's Tune,"Well I wandered alone,  
Through a desert of stone,  
And I dreamed of my future wife.  
My sword's in my hand,  
And I'm next in command,  
In this version of Death called Life.  
My plate and my cup,  
Are right straight up,  
I took a rose from the hand of a child.  
When I kiss your lips,  
The honey drips,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
Every day we meet,  
On any old street,  
And you're in your girlish prime.  
The short and the tall,  
Are coming to the ball,  
I go there all the time.  
Behind every tree,  
There's something to see,  
The river is wider than a mile.  
I tried you twice,  
You can't be nice,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
Here come the nurse,  
With money in her purse,  
Here come the ladies and men.  
You push it all in,  
And you've no chance to win,  
You play 'em on down to the end.  
I'm laying in the sand,  
Getting a sunshine tan,  
Moving along, riding in style.  
From my toes to my head,  
You knock me dead,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
I count the years,  
And I shed no tears,  
I'm blinded to what might have been.  
Nature's voice,  
Makes my heart rejoice,  
Play me the wild song of the wind.  
I found hopeless love,  
In the room above,  
When the sun and the weather were riled.  
You're as fine as wine,  
I ain't handing you no line,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
All the merry little elves,  
Can go hang themselves,  
My faith is as cold as can be.  
I'm stacked high to the roof,  
And I'm not without proof,  
If you don't believe me, come see.  
You think I'm blue,  
I think so, too,  
In my words you'll find no guile.  
The game's gotten old,  
The deck's gone cold,  
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
The game's gotten old,  
The deck's gone cold,  
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.

"
Bob Dylan,I And I,"Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed  
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams  
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed  
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Think I'll go out and go for a walk  
Not much happening here, nothing ever does  
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want to talk  
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever it was.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man see my face and lives.  
  
Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don't win the race  
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth  
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face  
And see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Outside of two men on a train platform there's nothing in sight  
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the trck  
The world could come to an end tonight, bt that's all right  
She could still be there sleeping when I get back.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Noontime, and I'm still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part  
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put  
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening with my heart  
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I go barefoot.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.

"
Bob Dylan,I Believe In You,"They ask me how I feel  
And if my love is real  
And how I know I'll make it through  
And they, they look at me and frown  
They'd like to drive me from this town  
They don't want me around  
'Cause I believe in you.  
  
They show me to the door  
They say don't come back no more  
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to  
And I, I walk out on my own  
A thousand miles from home  
But I don't feel alone  
'Cause I believe in you.  
  
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter  
I believe in you even though we be apart  
I believe in you even on the morning after  
Oh, when the dawn is nearing  
Oh, when the night is disappearing  
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart.  
  
Don't let me drift too far  
Keep me where you are  
Where I will always be renewed  
And that which you've given me today  
Is worth more than I could pay  
And no matter what they say  
I believe in you.  
  
I believe in you when winter turn to summer  
I believe in you when white turn to black  
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered  
Oh, though the earth may shake me  
Oh, though my friends forsake me  
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.  
  
Don't let me change my heart  
Keep me set apart  
From all the plans they do pursue  
And I, I don't mind the pain  
Don't mind the driving rain  
I know I will sustain  
'Cause I believe in you.

"
Bob Dylan,I Don't Believe You,"I can't understand, she let go of my hand  
An' left me here facing the wall  
I'd sure like to know, why she did go  
But I can't get close to her at all  
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime  
She said she would never forget  
But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here  
She acts like we never met  
It's all new to me like some mystery  
It could even be like a myth  
Yet it's hard to think on that she's the same one  
That last night I was with  
From darkness, dreams are deserted  
Am I still dreamin' yet?  
I wish she'd unlock her voice once an' talk  
'Stead of acting like we never met  
If she ain't feelin' well then why don't she tell  
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?  
Without any doubt, she seems too far out  
For me to return to her chase  
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played  
Her mouth was watery and wet  
But now something has changed for she ain't the same  
She just acts like we never have met  
If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess  
To anything I might've tried  
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong  
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide  
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling  
I remember her whispering yet  
But evidently she don't, evidently she won't  
She just acts like we never have met  
I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way  
Of this I can't say very much  
But if you want me to, I can be just like you  
An' pretend that we never have touched  
An' if anybody asks me, ""Is it easy to forget?""  
I'll say, ""It's easily done  
You just pick anyone  
An' pretend that you never have met""  

"
Bob Dylan,I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine,"I dreamed I saw St. Augustine  
Alive as you or me  
Tearing through these quarters  
In the utmost misery  
With a blanket underneath his arm  
And a coat of solid gold  
Searching for the very souls  
Whom already have been sold.  
  
""Arise, arise"", he cried so loud  
With a voice without restraint  
""Come out ye gifted kings and queens  
And hear my sad complaint  
No martyr is among ye now  
Whom you can call your own  
So go on your way accordingly  
But know you're not alone"".  
  
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine  
Alive with fiery breath  
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones  
That put him out to death  
Oh, I awoke in anger  
So alone and terrified  
I put my fingers against the glass  
And bowed my head and cried.

"
Bob Dylan,I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know,"I forgot more than you'll ever know about her  
  
You think you know  
The smile on her lips  
The thrill an' the touch  
Of her fingertips  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her  
  
You think you'll find  
A heaven of bliss  
In each caress  
In each tender kiss  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her  
  
You stole her love from me one day  
You didn't care how it hurt me  
But you can never steal away  
Memories of what used to be  
You think she's yours  
To have and to hold  
Someday you'll learn  
When her love grows cold  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

"
Bob Dylan,I Pity The Poor Immigrant,"I pity the poor immigrant  
Who wishes he would've stayed home,  
Who uses all his power to do evil  
But in the end is always left so alone.  
That man whom with his fingers cheats  
And who lies with ev'ry breath,  
Who passionately hates his life  
And likewise, fears his death.  
  
I pity the poor immigrant  
Whose strength is spent in vain,  
Whose heaven is like Ironsides,  
Whose tears are like rain,  
Who eats but is not satisfied,  
Who hears but does not see,  
Who falls in love with wealth itself  
And turns his back on me.  
  
I pity the poor immigrant  
Who tramples through the mud,  
Who fills his mouth with laughing  
And who builds his town with blood,  
Whose visions in the final end  
Must shatter like the glass.  
I pity the poor immigrant  
When his gladness comes to pass.

"
Bob Dylan,I Shall Be Free,"Well, I took me a woman late last night,  
I's three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight.  
She took off her wheel, took off her bell,  
Took off her wig, said, ""How do I smell?""  
I hot-footed it, bare-naked  
Out the window!  
  
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,  
Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk.  
Don't hurt me none, don't hurt my pride  
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.  
(Right there  
Proud as can be)  
  
I's out there paintin' on the old woodshed  
When a can a black paint it fell on my head.  
I went down to scrub and rub  
But I had to sit in back of the tub.  
Cost a quarter  
And I had to get out quick  
Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna  
  
Well, my telephone rang it would not stop,  
It's President Kennedy callin' me up.  
He said, ""My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?""  
I said, ""My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,  
Anita Ekberg,  
Sophia Loren.""  
Put 'em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!  
  
Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot,  
She yells and hollers and squeals a lot.  
Licks my face and tickles my ear,  
Bends me over and buys me beer.  
(She's a honeymooner  
A June crooner  
A spoon feeder  
And a natural leader)  
  
Oh, there ain't no use in me workin' so heavy,  
I got a woman who works on the levee.  
Pumping that water up to her neck,  
Every week she sends me a monthly check.  
She's a humdinger  
Folk singer  
Dead ringer  
For a thing-a-muh jigger  
  
Late one day in the middle of the week,  
Eyes were closed I was half asleep.  
I chased me a woman up the hill,  
Right in the middle of an air raid drill.  
It was Little Bo Peep!  
(I jumped a fallout shelter  
I jumped a bean stalk  
I jumped a Ferris wheel)  
  
Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote,  
He's a-runnin' for office on the ballot note.  
He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple,  
Tellin' me he loves all kinds-a people.  
(He's eatin' bagels  
He's eatin' pizza  
He's eatin' chitlins  
He's eatin' bullshit!)  
  
Oh, set me down on a television floor,  
I'll flip the channel to number four.  
Out of the shower comes a grown-up man  
With a bottle of hair oil in his hand.  
(It's that greasy kid stuff.  
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is  
What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner,  
Charles de Gaulle  
And Robert Louis Stevenson?)  
  
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen  
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.  
She takes about fifteen baths a day,  
Wants me to grow a cigar on my face.  
(She's a little bit heavy!)  
  
Well, ask me why I'm drunk alla time,  
It levels my head and eases my mind.  
I just walk along and stroll and sing,  
I see better days and I do better things.  
I catch dinosaurs  
I make love to Elizabeth Taylor  
Catch hell from Richard Burton!)

"
Bob Dylan,I Shall Be Free No. 10,"I'm just average, common too  
I'm just like him, the same as you  
I'm everybody's brother and son  
I ain't different from anyone  
It ain't no use a-talking to me  
It's just the same as talking to you.  
  
I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day  
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay  
I said ""Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come  
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine  
Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you'd better run  
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you  
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen.""  
  
Well, I don't know, but I've been told  
The streets in heaven are lined with gold  
I ask you how things could get much worse  
If the Russians happen to get up there first.  
Wowee! Pretty scary!  
  
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree  
I want ev'rybody to be free  
But if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater  
Move in next door and marry my daughter  
You must think I'm crazy!  
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.  
  
Well, I set my monkey on the log  
And ordered him to do the Dog  
He wagged his tail and shook his head  
And he went and did the Cat instead  
He's a weird monkey, very funky.  
  
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on  
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun  
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist  
And my wig-hat was falling in my face  
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.  
  
I gotta woman, she's so mean  
She sticks my boots in the washing machine  
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude  
Puts bubblegum in my food  
She's funny, wants my money, calls me ""honey.""  
  
Now I gotta friend who spends his life  
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife  
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf  
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.  
I've got a million friends!  
  
Now they asked me to read a poem  
At the sorority sister's home  
I got knocked down and my head was swimmin'  
I wound up with the Dean of Women  
Yippee! I'm a poet, and I know it.  
Hope I don't blow it.  
  
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange  
So I look like a walking mountain range  
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse  
Out to the country club and the golf course.  
Carry the New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds.  
  
Now you're probably wondering by now  
Just what this song is all about  
What's probably got you baffled more  
Is what this thing here is for.  
It's nothing  
It's something I learned over in England.

"
Bob Dylan,I Shall Be Released,"They say evrything can be replaced,  
Yet every distance is not near.  
So I remember every face  
Of every man who put me here.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.  
  
They say every man needs protection,  
They say every man must fall.  
Yet I swear I see my reflection  
Some place so high above this wall.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.  
  
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,  
Is a man who swears he's not to blame.  
All day long I hear him shout so loud,  
Crying out that he was framed.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.

"
Bob Dylan,I Threw It All Away,"I once held her in my arms,  
She said she would always stay.  
But I was cruel,  
I treated her like a fool,  
I threw it all away.  
  
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand,  
And rivers that ran through ev'ry day.  
I must have been mad,  
I never knew what I had,  
Until I threw it all away.  
  
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,  
Love and only love, it can't be denied.  
No matter what you think about it  
You just won't be able to do without it.  
Take a tip from one who's tried.  
  
So if you find someone that gives you all of her love,  
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray,  
For one thing that's certain,  
You will surely be a-hurtin',  
If you throw it all away.

Bob Dylan,I Wanna Be Your Lover,"Well, the rainman comes with his magic wand  
And the judge says, ""Mona can't have no bond.""  
And the walls collide, Mona cries,  
And the rain man leaves in the wolf man's disguise.  
  
I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man.  
I want to be your lover, baby,  
I don't want to be hers, I want to be yours.  
  
Well, the undertaker in his midnight suit  
Says to the masked man, ""ain't you cute!""  
Well, the mask man he gets up on the shelf  
And he says, ""you ain't so bad yourself.""  
  
I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man.  
I want to be your lover, baby,  
I don't want to be hers, I want to be yours.  
  
Well, jumpin' Judy can't go no higher.  
She had bullets in her eyes, and they fire.  
Rasputin he's so dignified,  
He touched the back of her head an' he died.  
  
I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man.  
I want to be your lover, baby,  
I don't want to be hers, I want to be yours.  
  
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,  
Stretchin' out upon the grass.  
She gets all messed up and she faints  
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't.  
  
I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man.  
I want to be your lover, baby,  
I don't want to be hers, I want to be yours.

"
Bob Dylan,I Want You,"The guilty undertaker sighs,  
The lonely organ grinder cries,  
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.  
The cracked bells and washed-out horns  
Blow into my face with scorn,  
But it's not that way,  
I wasn't born to lose you.  
I want you, I want you,  
I want you so bad,  
Honey, I want you.  
  
The drunken politician leaps  
Upon the street where mothers weep  
And the saviors who are fast asleep,  
They wait for you.  
And I wait for them to interrupt  
Me drinkin' from my broken cup  
And ask me to  
Open up the gate for you.  
I want you, I want you,  
I want you so bad,  
Honey, I want you.  
  
Now all my fathers, they've gone down,  
True love they've been without it.  
But all their daughters put me down  
Cause I don't think about it.  
  
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades  
And talk with my chambermaid.  
She knows that I'm not afraid  
To look at her.  
She is good to me  
And there's nothing she doesn't see.  
She knows where I'd like to be  
But it doesn't matter.  
I want you, I want you,  
I want you so bad,  
Honey, I want you.  
  
Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,  
He spoke to me, I took his flute.  
No, I wasn't very cute to him,  
Was I?  
But I did it, though, because he lied  
Because he took you for a ride  
And because time was on his side  
And because I  
I want you, I want you,  
I want you so bad,  
Honey, I want you.
