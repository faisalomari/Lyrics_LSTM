ABBA,Tropical Loveland,"Come to my loveland, wander along  
Beautiful gardens full of flowers and songs  
Come to the sunshine, beaches and sand  
Here's the two bluebirds, won't you come to my land  
  
The grass is mellow and the sky is blue  
My paradise is waiting here for you  
  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
Life can be funny  
Happy and sunny  
Oh, in my tropical loveland  
  
Come to my loveland, wander with me  
Lie with me darling in the shade of a tree  
Over the rainbow, under the moon  
That's where my land is, won't you come to me soon?  
  
Just take my hand, I'll show you everything  
The secrets that my paradise can bring  
  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
Life can be funny  
Happy and sunny  
Oh, in my tropical loveland  
  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
(I want to share it with you)  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
(It's a tropical loveland)

ABBA,Two For The Price Of One,"He had what you might call a trivial occupation  
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station  
With no romance in his life  
Sometimes he wished he had a wife  
He read the matrimonial advertising pages  
The cries for help from different people, different ages  
But they had nothing to say  
At least not until the day  
When something special he read  
This is what it said  
  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
  
He called the number and a voice said: ""Alice Whiting""  
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting  
He was amazed at his luck  
The purest streak of gold he'd struck  
He said: ""I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling  
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling  
Why don't we meet for a chat  
The three of us in my flat""  
I can't forget what I read  
This is what it said  
  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
  
She said: ""I'm sure we must be perfect for each other  
And if you doubt it, you'll be certain when you meet my mother""

ABBA,Under Attack,"Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go  
My resistance running low  
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so  
(You know that I'm nobody's fool)  
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me  
I don't have a strategy  
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be  
  
Under attack, I'm being taken  
About to crack, defenses breaking  
Won't somebody please have a heart  
Come and rescue now 'cause I'm falling apart  
Under attack, I'm taking cover  
He's on my track, my chasing lover  
Thinking nothing can stop him now  
But I want to know, should I want to, I'm not sure  
  
This is getting crazy, I should tell him so  
Really let my anger show  
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite ""no""  
(I'm kind of certain that's the truth)  
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well  
Something like a magic spell  
I hardly dare to think of what could happen, where I'd be if I fell  
  
Under attack, I'm being taken  
About to crack, defenses breaking  
Won't somebody please have a heart  
Come and rescue now 'cause I'm falling apart  
Under attack, I'm taking cover  
He's on my track, my chasing lover  
Thinking nothing can stop him now  
Should I want to, I'm not sure, I would know how

ABBA,What About Livingstone,"Went to buy me a paper at the local news-stand  
And then I heard them laugh and say  
Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now  
Hey, what's it good for anyway?  
So I said  
Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may  
  
What about Livingstone?  
What about all those men?  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
What about Livingstone?  
  
And all of those fellas at the local news-stand  
Didn't know what to answer or what to say  
So I told them about him, that he was just like  
One of those spacemen in his way  
And if you laugh at them  
Then there's only a thing I can say  
  
What about Livingstone?  
What about all those men?  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?

ABBA,When All Is Said And Done,"Here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill  
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill  
Birds of passage, you and me  
We fly instinctively  
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun  
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done  
  
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks  
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex  
We're still striving for the sky  
No taste for humble pie  
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun  
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done  
  
It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor  
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more  
Clear-headed and open-eyed  
With nothing left untried  
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run  
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done  
  
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run  
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done

ABBA,When I Kissed The Teacher,"Everybody screamed when I kissed the teacher  
And they must have thought they dreamed when I kissed the teacher  
All my friends at school  
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool  
Nearly petrified 'cause he was taken by surprise  
When I kissed the teacher  
Couldn't quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher  
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher  
Leaning over me, he was trying to explain the laws of geometry  
And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher  
All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher

When I kissed the teacher

ABBA,Why Did It Have To Be Me?,"When you were lonely, you needed a man  
Someone to lean on, well I understand  
It's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold  
So you were looking for someone to hold  
That's only natural

Always thought you knew the reason why  
I only wanted a little love affair  
Now I can see you are beginning to care  
But baby, believe me  
It's better to forget me  
  
Men are toys in the game that you play  
When you get tired, you throw them away  
That's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
Falling in love with a woman like you  
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do  
It's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?

I remember how your body started trembling  
Oh what a night it's been, and for the state I'm in  
I'm still alone

And all the wonders made for the earth  
And all the hearts in all creation  
Somehow I always end up alone  
  
Always end up alone, always end up alone  
So I'll play, I'll wait

We came (sha la) so close (so far)  
Just the beat of a lonely heart  
And it's mine, and I don't want to be alone  
  
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone  
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home  
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere  
But I'm still alone  
  
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate  
'Cause I know it isn't heaven is it love or hate  
Am I the subject of the pain  
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone  
  
And is there glory there to behold  
Maybe it's my imagination another story there to be told

So what's wrong with you, ah...  
  
You're so blown up with anger about the world  
You write the songs about  
Yet you don't even know your neighbors name  
Now you want to go the the moon and live there  
When you know it'll only end up the same  
How can he give you any gratitude,  
With your endless sickenin' attitude  
You strive to get ahead  
But you leave each other dead  
Can't you see, children laughin',  
Voices singin', hearts beatin' like they always do  
So what's wrong with you, ah...  
  
Children laughin', voices singin' hearts beatin'  
Children laughin', voices singin', (fade)

Bee Gees,And The Sun Will Shine,"And the rain will fall, it falls for you.  
And the clouds will break into tears,  
You should be here standing so near to me.  
  
'Cept I know you should be sad  
But give me time alone to get it out of my mind.  
Though say I know it's only the weather.  
'Cause every time it rains you are gone.  
And I'm blue.  
Then I wake up, then I wake up.  
  
And the sun will shine if just for you.  
And the trees will talk to the skies, whispering lies,  
Heaven will pass to me, yeah.  
Trains walk by and the birds disappear.  
Oh! Why am I still here without you by my side.  
So I cry your name and love,  
The thought to me is back and how near.  
Then I wake up, then I grow up.  
  
And the rain will fall.  
It falls for you.  
And the clouds will break  
It should be near.  
And the sun will shine

It gets stronger every day

All the world was on our side  
We had the power of the universe  
And we were ready  
We were ready for the ride  
  
Moonlight in her hair  
Her eyes the wonder of the age  
But all I mean to you my love  
Is just a spotlight on an empty stage  
  
And through it all  
One fire in the rain  
Keeps burning on, keeps burning on  
I can't stop my heart  
It's beating for you  
Reaching for you  
But you are gone  
I'm empty inside, I'm empty inside  
And where are you

Bob Dylan,Idiot Wind,"Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press  
Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out but when they will I can only guess.  
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,  
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me.  
I can't help it if I'm lucky.  
  
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act  
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts.  
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at,  
I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that  
Sweet lady.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth,  
Blowing down the back roads headin' south.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike  
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.  
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door,  
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won
the wars  
After losin' every battle.  
  
I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are  
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see
stars.  
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies.  
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes,  
Blood on your saddle.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb,  
Blowing through the curtains in your room.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart  
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.  
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have
stopped,  
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top  
You're on the bottom.  
  
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind  
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes  
Don't look into mine.  
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
building  
Burned.  
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the
springtime  
Turned Slowly into autumn.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull,  
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read  
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I was somebody else instead.  
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,  
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory  
And all your ragin' glory.  
  
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,  
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from
me.  
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above,  
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love,  
And it makes me feel so sorry.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats,  
Blowing through the letters that we wrote.  
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves,  
We're idiots, babe.  
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.

Bob Dylan,If Dogs Run Free,"If dogs run free, then why not we  
Across the swooping plain?  
My ears hear a symphony  
Of two mules, trains and rain.  
The best is always yet to come,  
That's what they explain to me.  
Just do your thing, you'll be king,  
If dogs run free.  
  
If dogs run free, why not me  
Across the swamp of time?  
My mind weaves a symphony  
And tapestry of rhyme.  
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee  
So it may flow and be,  
To each his own, it's all unknown,  
If dogs run free.  
  
If dogs run free, then what must be,  
Must be, and that is all.  
True love can make a blade of grass  
Stand up straight and tall.  
In harmony with the cosmic sea,  
True love needs no company,  
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole,  
If dogs run free.

Bob Dylan,If You See Her Say Hello,"If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier  
She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear  
Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow  
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.  
  
We had a falling-out, like lovers often will  
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill  
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart  
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.  
  
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me  
I always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free  
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way  
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her
stay.  
  
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds  
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town  
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off  
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft.  
  
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past  
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast  
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find  
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.

Bob Dylan,I'm Not There,"She came all rightoned and she's all too tight in my neighborhood  
She cried both day and night  
I know it because it was there.  
It's a milestone, but she's down on her luck  
And she daily salooning, but to me too hot to book  
I would then.  
  
I believe where she'd stop in if she wants time to care  
I believe that she'd look upon beside him to care  
And I go by the Lord and where she's on my way, but I don't belong there.  
No I don't belong to her, I don't belong to every choir  
She's my prize forsaken angel, but she don't hear me cry  
She's a long hearted mystic and she can't carry on  
When I'm there she's alright, but when she's not when I'm gone.  
Heaven knows that the answers she's don't calling no one  
She's the way for sailing beautiful  
She's mine for the one  
And I lost her attention by tempation as it runs  
But she don't bother me  
But I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Now I've cried tonight like I cried the night before  
And I'm leased on the high some  
But I dream about the door  
It's so long she's forsaken by a fate with the tale  
It don't hang approximation  
She smiled Fare Thee Well.  
  
Now when I'll treat the way we all was born to love her  
But she knows that the kingdom weighs so high above her  
And I run but I wait  
And it's not too fast or slam  
But I'll not perceive her  
I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's all about division  
And I cry for a bail  
I don't need anybody now beside me to tell  
And it's all affirmation I received but it's not  
She's a long haunting beauty  
But she's gone like the spark  
And she's gone.  
  
Yes she's gone like the rainbow that shined in yesterday  
But now she's home beside me  
And I'd like to hear to stay  
She's a bone forsaking beauty and it don't trust anyone  
Now I wish I was beside her but I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's too hard to stake in  
And I don't far believe  
It's a bag full it's amusing  
That she's hard too hard to lead.  
It's a load, it's a crime  
The way she mauled me around  
Was she told for to hate me, but just don't forethink in clown.  
  
Yes I believe that it's rightful  
Oh I believe it in my mind

Carry on the grind.  
And this song gypsy told her like I said carry on  
I wish I was there to help her  
But I'm not there I'm gone.

Lord, in my time of dying don't want nobody to cry  
All I want you to do is take me when I die  
Well, well, well, so I can die easy  
Well, well, well  
Well, well, well, so I can die easy  
Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up  
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.

Bob Dylan,In The Garden,"When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?  
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?  
Did they know He was the Son of God, did they know that He was Lord?  
Did they hear when He told Peter, ""Peter, put up your sword""?  
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?

When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?  
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?  
Nicodemus came at night so he wouldn't be seen by men  
Saying, ""Master, tell me why a man must be born again.""

When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?

Same thing My Father do, I can do likewise.""

Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?

Bob Dylan,Is Your Love In Vain ?,"Do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?  
Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?  
I've been burned before and I know the score  
So you won't hear me complain.  
Will I be able to count on you  
Or is your love in vain?  
  
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?  
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?  
Do you know my world, do you know my kind  
Or must I explain?  
Will you let me be myself  
Or is your love in vain?  
  
Well I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,  
I've been in and out of happiness.  
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings  
And I've never been too impressed.  
  
All right, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you  
If I'm a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too.  
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow,  
Do you understand my pain?  
Are you willing to risk it all  
Or is your love in vain?

Bob Dylan,Isis,"I married Isis on the fifth day of May  
But I could not hold on to her very long  
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away  
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.  
  
I came to a high place of darkness and light  
The dividing line ran through the center of town  
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right  
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.  
  
A man in the corner approached me for a match  
I knew right away he was not ordinary  
He said ""Are you looking for something easy to catch ?""  
I said ""I got no money"". He said ""That ain't necessary"".  
  
We set out that night for the cold in the North  
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word  
I said ""Where are we going ?"" He said ""We'd be back by the fourth""  
I said ""That's the best new that I've ever heard"".  
  
I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold  
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace  
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold  
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so reckless.  
  
How she told me that one day we meet up again  
And things would be different the next time we wed  
If I only could hang on and just be her friend  
I still can't remember all the best things she said.  
  
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice  
He said ""There's a body I'm trying to find  
If I carry it out it'll bring a good prize""  
It was then that I knew what he had on his mind.  
  
The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous  
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn  
When he died I was hoping that it wasn't contagious  
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.  
I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty  
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I'd been had  
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly  
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.  
  
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside  
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover  
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied  
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.  
  
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise  
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed  
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes  
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.  
  
She said ""Where ya been ?"" I said ""No place special ?""  
She said ""You look different"" I said ""Well I guess""  
She said ""You been gone"" I said ""That's only natural""  
She said ""You gonna stay ?"" I said ""If you want me to, Yeah "".  
  
Isis oh Isis you mystical child  
What drives me to you is what drives me insane  
I still can remember the way that you smiled  
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.

Bob Dylan,"It Ain't Me, Babe","Go 'way from my window  
Leave at your own chosen speed  
I'm not the one you want, babe  
I'm not the one you need  
You say you're lookin' for someone  
Who's never weak but always strong  
To protect you an' defend you  
Whether you are right or wrong  
Someone to open each and every door  
But it ain't me, babe  
No, no, no, it ain't me babe  
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.  
  
Go lightly from the ledge, babe  
Go lightly on the ground  
I'm not the one you want, babe  
I will only let your down  
You say you're lookin' for someone  
Who will promise never to part  
Someone to close his eyes for you  
Someone to close his heart  
Someone who will die for you an' more  
But it ain't me, babe  
No, no, no, it ain't me babe  
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.  
  
Go melt back into the night  
Everything inside is made of stone  
There's nothing in here moving  
An' anyway I'm not alone  
You say you're looking for someone  
Who'll pick you up each time you fall  
To gather flowers constantly  
An' to come each time you call  
A lover for you life an' nothing more  
But it ain't me, babe  
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe  
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

Bob Dylan,It Hurts Me Too,"So run here baby, put your little hands in mine  
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind  
When things go wrong, so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
  
I want you baby just to understand  
I don't want to be your boss babe, I just want to be your man  
When things go wrong, so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
  
Now when you go home, you don't have to get along  
Come back to me babe, where I live that's where you belong  
When things go wrong, so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
  
I love you baby an' you know that it's true  
I wouldn't mistreat you baby, nothin' in this world is like you  
When things go wrong, so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
Yes when things go wrong, so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
  
So run here baby, put your little hand in mine  
I got something to tell you baby, I know that will change your mind  
When things go wrong, so wrong with you  
Don't you know it, don't you know it hurts me too

Bob Dylan,"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue","You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last  
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast  
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun  
Crying like a fire in the sun  
Look out the saints are comin' through  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense  
Take what you have gathered from coincidence  
The empty-handed painter from your streets  
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets  
This sky, too, is folding under you  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home  
All your reindeer armies, are all going home  
The lover who just walked out your door  
Has taken all his blankets from the floor  
The carpet, too, is moving under you  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you  
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you  
The vagabond who's rapping at your door  
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore  
Strike another match, go start anew  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
